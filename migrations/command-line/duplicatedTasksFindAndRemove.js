/*
 * IMPORTANT:
 *
 * DO NOT TRUST THIS SCRIPT YET
 *
 *
 * This has been written by Alys to identify and remove duplicated tasks
 * i.e., tasks that have the same `id` value as another task.
 * However it could almost certainly be improved (the aggregation step HAS
 * to be easier that this!) and Alys is still working on it. Improvements
 * welcome.
 *
 * If you use it, do ALL of the following things:
 *
 * - configuration, as described below
 * - make a full backup of the user's data
 * - be aware of how to restore the user's data from that backup
 * - test the script first on a local copy of the database
 * - dump the user's data to a text file before running the script so that
 *   it can later be compared to a dump made afterwards
 * - run the script once first with both of the db.users.update() commands
 *   commented-out and check that the printed task IDs are correct
 * - run the script with all code enabled
 * - dump the user's data to a text file after running the script
 * - diff the two dumps to ensure that only the correct tasks were removed
 *
 *
 * When two tasks exist with the same ID, only one of those tasks will be
 * removed (whichever copy the script finds first).
 * If three tasks exist with the same ID, you'll probably need to run this
 * script twice.
 *

// - Change the uuid below to be the user's uuid.
// - Change ALL instances of "todos" to "habits"/"dailys"/"rewards" as
//   needed. Do not miss any of them!
