    "faqQuestion0": "Sono confuso. Come funziona Habitica?",
    "iosFaqAnswer0": "Per prima cosa, imposterai un'attività che vuoi completare nella vita di tutti i giorni, quindi, completando le tue attività nella vita vera e spuntandole, riceverai esperienza ed oro. L'oro è usato per comprare equipaggiamento e alcuni item, insieme ad dei premi personalizzati. L'esperienza serve a far salire di livello il tuo personaggio e sbloccare contenuti come animali domestici, abilità, e missioni! Puoi personalizzare il tuo personaggio in Menu > Personalizza Avatar.\n\nAlcuni metodi basilari per interagire: cliccare il (+) nell'angolo in alto a destra per aggiungere una nuova attività. Cliccare su un'attività già presente per modificarla e strisciare verso sinistra per eliminarla. Puoi organizare le attività usando le etichette nell'angolo in alto a sinistra, espandi e contrai checklist cliccando nella bolla vicine alle suddette.",
    "webFaqAnswer0": "First, you'll set up tasks that you want to do in your everyday life. Then, as you complete the tasks in real life and check them off, you'll earn Experience and Gold. Gold is used to buy equipment and some items, as well as custom rewards. Experience causes your character to level up and unlock content such as pets, skills, and quests! For more detail, the wiki has an excellent step-by-step overview of the game [right here](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Habitica_Wiki).",
    "faqQuestion1": "How do I set up my tasks?",
    "iosFaqAnswer1": "Good Habits (the ones with a +) are tasks that you can do many times a day, such as eating vegetables. Bad Habits (the ones with a -) are tasks that you should avoid, like biting nails. Habits with a + and a - have a good choice and a bad choice, like taking the stairs vs. taking the elevator. Good Habits award experience and gold. Bad Habits subtract health.\n\n Dailies are tasks that you have to do every day, like brushing your teeth or checking your email. You can adjust the days that a Daily is due by tapping to edit it. If you skip a Daily that is due, your avatar will take damage overnight. Be careful not to add too many Dailies at once!\n\n To-Dos are your To-Do list. Completing a To-Do earns you gold and experience. You never lose health from To-Dos. You can add a due date to a To-Do by tapping to edit.",

    "faqQuestion3": "Perchè le mie attività cambiano colore?",
    "iosFaqAnswer3": "Your tasks change color based on how well you are currently accomplishing them! Each new task starts out as a neutral yellow. Perform Dailies or positive Habits more frequently and they move toward blue. Miss a Daily or give in to a bad Habit and the task moves toward red. The redder a task, the more rewards it will give you, but if it's a Daily or bad Habit, the more it will hurt you! This helps motivate you to complete the tasks that are giving you trouble.",

    "faqQuestion4": "Perche' il mio personaggio ha perso dei punti vita e come faccio a ripristinarli?",
    "iosFaqAnswer4": "Ci sono diverse ragioni per cui puoi venire ferito. Il motivo principale e' l'aver lasciato incompiute alcune tue Dailies durante la notte, queste mancanze ti danneggiano. In secondo luogo, se clicchi su di una Habit negativa, questa ti danneggera'. Ed in fine, se ti trovi a fronteggiare un Boss in una battaglia con la tua Squadra ed uno dei tuoi compagni non completa tutte le sue Dailies, il Boss vi attacchera'.\n\nLa via principale per riguadagnare i tuoi punti salute e' salire di livello, questo ti fara' recuperare completamente salute. Puoi inoltre comprare con dell'oro una Pozione Salute nella colonna delle Ricompense. Inoltre, dal livello 10 in poi, puoi scegliere di diventare un Guaritore ed imparerai cosi' degli incantesimi di guarigione. Se ti trovi in Squadra con un Guaritore, puoi beneficiare del suo aiuto.",

They will be stored in Menu > Items.\n\n To hatch a Pet, you'll need an egg and a hatching potion. Tap on the egg to determine the species you want to hatch, and select \"Hatch Egg.\" Then choose a hatching potion to determine its color!

    "faqQuestion7": "How do I become a Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Healer?",
    "iosFaqAnswer7": "At level 10, you can choose to become a Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Healer. (All players start as Warriors by default.) Each Class has different equipment options, different Skills that they can cast after level 11, and different advantages. Warriors can easily damage Bosses, withstand more damage from their tasks, and help make their Party tougher. Mages can also easily damage Bosses, as well as level up quickly and restore Mana for their party. Rogues earn the most gold and find the most item drops, and they can help their Party do the same. Finally, Healers can heal themselves and their Party members.\n\n If you don't want to choose a Class immediately -- for example, if you are still working to buy all the gear of your current class -- you can click “Decide Later” and choose later under Menu > Choose Class.",

    "faqQuestion8": "What is the blue stat bar that appears in the Header after level 10?",
    "iosFaqAnswer8": "The blue bar that appeared when you hit level 10 and chose a Class is your Mana bar. As you continue to level up, you will unlock special Skills that cost Mana to use. Each Class has different Skills, which appear after level 11 under Menu > Use Skills. Unlike your health bar, your Mana bar does not reset when you gain a level. Instead, Mana is gained when you complete Good Habits, Dailies, and To-Dos, and lost when you indulge bad Habits. You'll also regain some Mana overnight -- the more Dailies you completed, the more you will gain.",

    "faqQuestion9": "How do I fight monsters and go on Quests?",
    "iosFaqAnswer9": "First, you need to join or start a Party (see above). Although you can battle monsters alone, we recommend playing in a group, because this will make Quests much easier. Plus, having a friend to cheer you on as you accomplish your tasks is very motivating!\n\n Next, you need a Quest Scroll, which are stored under Menu > Items. There are three ways to get a scroll:\n\n - At level 15, you get a Quest-line, aka three linked quests. More Quest-lines unlock at levels 30, 40, and 60 respectively. \n - When you invite people to your Party on the [website](https://habitica.com/#/options/groups/party), you'll be rewarded with the Basi-List Scroll! (We will add this feature to the app in a future update.)\n - You can buy Quests from the Quests Page on the [website](https://habitica.com/#/options/inventory/quests) for gold and gems. (We will add this feature to the app in a future update.)\n\n To battle the Boss or collect items for a Collection Quest, simply complete your tasks normally, and they will be tallied into damage overnight. (Reloading by pulling down on the screen may be required to see the Boss's health bar go down.) If you are fighting a Boss and you missed any Dailies, the Boss will damage your Party at the same time that you damage the Boss. \n\n After level 11 Mages and Warriors will gain Skills that allow them to deal additional damage to the Boss, so these are excellent classes to choose at level 10 if you want to be a heavy hitter.",
