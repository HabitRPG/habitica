    "faqQuestion1": "¿Cómo puedo establecer mis tareas?",
    "iosFaqAnswer1": "Good Habits (the ones with a +) are tasks that you can do many times a day, such as eating vegetables. Bad Habits (the ones with a -) are tasks that you should avoid, like biting nails. Habits with a + and a - have a good choice and a bad choice, like taking the stairs vs. taking the elevator. Good Habits award experience and gold. Bad Habits subtract health.\n\n Dailies are tasks that you have to do every day, like brushing your teeth or checking your email. You can adjust the days that a Daily is due by tapping to edit it. If you skip a Daily that is due, your avatar will take damage overnight. Be careful not to add too many Dailies at once!\n\n To-Dos are your To-Do list. Completing a To-Do earns you gold and experience. You never lose health from To-Dos. You can add a due date to a To-Do by tapping to edit.",
    "webFaqAnswer1": "Los Buenos Hábitos (aquellos con un <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-plus'></span>) son tareas que puede realizar varias veces al día, como por ejemplo, comer vegetales. Los Malos Hábitos (aquellos con un <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-minus'></span>) son tareas que debería evitar, como por ejemplo, morderse las uñas. Los Hábitos con un <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-plus'></span> y un <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-minus'></span> ofrecen una buena y una mala elección, como subir por las escaleras en oposición a usar el ascensor. Los Buenos Hábitos otorgan Experiencia y Oro. Los Malos Hábitos restan Salud.\n<br><br>\nLas Diarias son tareas que debe realizar cada día, como por ejemplo lavarse los dientes o revisar el correo electrónico. Puede ajustar los días en los que debe realizar una Diaria haciendo click en el lápiz para editar la tarea. Si se salta una Daria que está aún pendiente, su avatar recibirá daño durante la noche. ¡Tenga cuidado de no añadir demasiadas Diarias al mismo tiempo!\n<br><br>\nLas Tareas Pendientes son su lista de cosas por hacer. Completar una Tarea Pendiente le hará ganar Oro y Experiencia. Nunca perderás Salud por no completar las Tareas Pendientes. Puede incluir una fecha límite a una Tarea Pendiente haciendo click en el icono del lápiz para editarla.",

    "faqQuestion3": "¿Por qué las tareas cambian de color?",
    "iosFaqAnswer3": "Your tasks change color based on how well you are currently accomplishing them! Each new task starts out as a neutral yellow. Perform Dailies or positive Habits more frequently and they move toward blue. Miss a Daily or give in to a bad Habit and the task moves toward red. The redder a task, the more rewards it will give you, but if it's a Daily or bad Habit, the more it will hurt you! This helps motivate you to complete the tasks that are giving you trouble.",

    "faqQuestion4": "¿Por qué mi avatar pierde salud y cómo puedo recuperarla?",
    "iosFaqAnswer4": "There are several things that can cause you to take damage. First, if you left Dailies incomplete overnight, they will damage you. Second, if you tap a bad Habit, it will damage you. Finally, if you are in a Boss Battle with your Party and one of your Party mates did not complete all their Dailies, the Boss will attack you.\n\n The main way to heal is to gain a level, which restores all your health. You can also buy a Health Potion with gold from the Rewards column. Plus, at level 10 or above, you can choose to become a Healer, and then you will learn healing skills. If you are in a Party with a Healer, they can heal you as well.",

    "faqQuestion5": "¿Cómo puedo jugar a Habitica con mis amigos?",
    "iosFaqAnswer5": "The best way is to invite them to a Party with you! Parties can go on quests, battle monsters, and cast skills to support each other. Go to Menu > Party and click \"Create New Party\" if you don't already have a Party. Then tap on the Members list, and tap Invite in the upper right-hand corner to invite your friends by entering their User ID (a string of numbers and letters that they can find under Settings > Account Details on the app, and Settings > API on the website). On the website, you can also invite friends via email, which we will add to the app in a future update.\n\nOn the website, you and your friends can also join Guilds, which are public chat rooms.

    "faqQuestion6": "¿Cómo puedo encontrar una mascota o una montura?",
    "iosFaqAnswer6": "At level 3, you will unlock the Drop System. Every time you complete a task, you'll have a random chance at receiving an egg, a hatching potion, or a piece of food. They will be stored in Menu > Items.\n\n To hatch a Pet, you'll need an egg and a hatching potion. Tap on the egg to determine the species you want to hatch, and select \"Hatch Egg.\" Then choose a hatching potion to determine its color! Go to Menu > Pets to equip your new Pet to your avatar by clicking on it. \n\n You can also grow your Pets into Mounts by feeding them under Menu > Pets. Tap on a Pet, and then select \"Feed Pet\"!

    "faqQuestion7": "¿Cómo me convierto en Guerrero, Mago, Pícaro o Sanador?",
    "iosFaqAnswer7": "En nivel 10, puedes elegir convertirte en Guerrero, Mago, Pícaro o Sanador. (Todos los jugadores comienzan como Guerreros por defecto). Cada Clase tiene distintas opciones de equipamiento, distintas habilidades que pueden usar a partir del nivel 11, y distintas ventajas. Los guerreros pueden hacerle daño fácilmente a los Jefes, resistir más daño de sus tareas, y ayudar a que su Equipo se haga más fuerte. Los magos también pueden hacerle mucho daño a los Jefes, y subir rápidamente de nivel y restaurar la maná de su equipo. Los Pícaros son los que más oro ganan y más botines encuentran, y pueden ayudar a que su equipo también lo haga. Finalmente, los Sanadores pueden curarse a ellos mismos y a su equipo. \n\nSi no quieres elegir una Clase inmediatamente - por ejemplo, si todavía estás trabajando para comprar todo el equipamiento de tu clase actual - puedes hacer clic en \"Decidir más tarde\" y elegir más tarde en Menú > Elegir Clase.

    "webFaqAnswer7": "At level 10, you can choose to become a Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Healer. (All players start as Warriors by default.) Each Class has different equipment options, different Skills that they can cast after level 11, and different advantages. Warriors can easily damage Bosses, withstand more damage from their tasks, and help make their party tougher. Mages can also easily damage Bosses, as well as level up quickly and restore Mana for their party. Rogues earn the most Gold and find the most item drops, and they can help their party do the same. Finally, Healers can heal themselves and their party members.\n<br><br>\n If you don't want to choose a Class immediately -- for example, if you are still working to buy all the gear of your current class -- you can click \"Opt Out\" and re-enable it later under User > Stats.",
    "faqQuestion8": "Cual es la barra estadística azul que aparece en la parte de arrriba después de el nivel 10",
    "iosFaqAnswer8": "The blue bar that appeared when you hit level 10 and chose a Class is your Mana bar. As you continue to level up, you will unlock special Skills that cost Mana to use. Each Class has different Skills, which appear after level 11 under Menu > Use Skills. Unlike your health bar, your Mana bar does not reset when you gain a level. Instead, Mana is gained when you complete Good Habits, Dailies, and To-Dos, and lost when you indulge bad Habits. You'll also regain some Mana overnight -- the more Dailies you completed, the more you will gain.",

    "faqQuestion9": "¿Cómo peleo con los monstruos y hago misiones?",
    "iosFaqAnswer9": "First, you need to join or start a Party (see above). Although you can battle monsters alone, we recommend playing in a group, because this will make Quests much easier. Plus, having a friend to cheer you on as you accomplish your tasks is very motivating!\n\n Next, you need a Quest Scroll, which are stored under Menu > Items. There are three ways to get a scroll:\n\n - At level 15, you get a Quest-line, aka three linked quests. More Quest-lines unlock at levels 30, 40, and 60 respectively. \n - When you invite people to your Party, you'll be rewarded with the Basi-List Scroll!\n - You can buy Quests from the Quests Page on the [website](https://habitica.com/#/options/inventory/quests) for Gold and Gems. (We will add this feature to the app in a future update.)\n\n To battle the Boss or collect items for a Collection Quest, simply complete your tasks normally, and they will be tallied into damage overnight. (Reloading by pulling down on the screen may be required to see the Boss's health bar go down.) If you are fighting a Boss and you missed any Dailies, the Boss will damage your Party at the same time that you damage the Boss. \n\n After level 11 Mages and Warriors will gain Skills that allow them to deal additional damage to the Boss, so these are excellent classes to choose at level 10 if you want to be a heavy hitter.",
