Residents claim a monster with an enormous serpentine body lies in wait under the sands, and they have all pooled together a reward for whomever will help them find and stop it. The much-lauded snake charmers @EmeraldOx and @PainterProphet have agreed to help you summon the beast. Can you stop the Serpent of Distraction?",

Though you were happy to help the inhabitants of the Dunes, you can't help but feel a little sad for your fallen foe. While you contemplate the sights, @LordDarkly approaches you. \"Thank you! It's not much, but I hope this can express our gratitude properly.\" He hands you some Gold and... some Snake eggs! You will see that majestic animal again after all.",

She allows you to ride on her back as she soars to the source of Conquest Creek. As she lowers her golden horn to the befouled waters, a brilliant blue light rises from the water’s surface. It is so blinding that you are forced to close your eyes. When you open them a moment later, the unicorn is gone.
