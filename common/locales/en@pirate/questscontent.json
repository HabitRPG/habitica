The final Exhaust Spirit transforms into the Joyful Reaper herself!\n\n\"Look!\" whispers @Baconsaur, as the ashes begin to glitter.

As fallen quest scrolls smolder, the smoke clears, and you see that Ian has been drained of energy and turned into a drifting Exhaust Spirit!\n\nOnly defeating Burnout can break the spell and restore our beloved Quest Master.

However, something has even the locals spooked. The sands have been shifting and upturning entire villages. Residents claim a monster with an enormous serpentine body lies in wait under the sands, and they have all pooled together a reward for whomever will help them find and stop it. The much-lauded snake charmers @EmeraldOx and @PainterProphet have agreed to help you summon the beast. Can you stop the Serpent of Distraction?",

Though you were happy to help the inhabitants of the Dunes, you can't help but feel a little sad for your fallen foe. While you contemplate the sights, @LordDarkly approaches you. \"Thank you! It's not much, but I hope this can express our gratitude properly.\" He hands you some Gold and... some Snake eggs! You will see that majestic animal again after all.",

She allows you to ride on her back as she soars to the source of Conquest Creek. As she lowers her golden horn to the befouled waters, a brilliant blue light rises from the water’s surface. It is so blinding that you are forced to close your eyes. When you open them a moment later, the unicorn is gone. However, @rosiesully lets out a cry of delight: the water is now clear, and three shining eggs rest at the creek’s edge.",
