    "tagline": "A free habit building app that treats your life like a game.",
    "landingp1": "The problem with most productivity apps on the market is that they provide no incentive to continue using them. HabitRPG fixes this by making habit building fun! By rewarding you for your successes and penalising you for slip-ups, HabitRPG provides external motivation for completing your day-to-day activities.",
    "landingp2header": "Instant Gratification",
    "landingp2": "Whenever you reinforce a positive habit, complete a daily task, or take care of an old to-do, HabitRPG immediately rewards you with experience points and gold. As you gain experience, you can level up, increasing your stats and unlocking more features, like classes and pets. Gold can be spent on in-game items that change your experience or personalised rewards you've created for motivation. When even the smallest successes provide you with an immediate reward, you're less likely to procrastinate.",
    "landingp3header": "Consequences",
    "landingp3": "Whenever you indulge in a bad habit or fail to complete one of your daily tasks, you lose health. If your health drops too low, you die and lose some of the progress you've made. By providing immediate consequences, HabitRPG can help break bad habits and procrastination cycles before they cause real-world problems.",
    "landingp4header": "Accountability",
    "landingp4": "With an active community, HabitRPG provides the accountability you need to stay on task. With the party system, you can bring in a group of your closest friends to cheer you on. The guild system allows you to find people with similar interests or obstacles, so you can share your goals and swap tips on how to tackle your problems. On HabitRPG, the community means that you have both the support and the accountability you need to succeed.",

    "marketing1Header": "Improve Your Habits By Playing A Game",
    "marketing1Lead1": "HabitRPG is a video game to help you improve real life habits. It \"gamifies\" your life by turning all your tasks (habits, dailies, and to-dos) into little monsters you have to conquer. The better you are at this, the more you progress in the game. If you slip up in life, your character starts backsliding in the game.",

    "marketing2Lead1": "While you can solo-play HabitRPG, the lights really turn on when you start collaborating, competing, and holding each other accountable.
