                <br>
                We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, 
                and without prior notice, by posting an amended Privacy Policy that is 
                always accessible by clicking on the "Privacy Policy" link on this

                <strong>3. Collection of Anonymous, Passive Information.</strong>
                <br>
                We reserve the right to monitor your use of the services. As you 
                navigate through the services, certain anonymous information may be 
                passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing 
                the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet 
                tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server 
                logs, clickstream). The following is a listing and a brief explanation 
                of passive information collection methodologies which we may use from 
                time to time to better understand how the Services are being used. 
            </p>
            <p>
                3.1 A "cookie" is a text file that this site sends to your 
                browser in the form of a text file The information generated by the 
                cookie about your use of this site (including your IP address) will be 
                transmitted to and stored. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, 
                but they usually can be modified to decline cookies if you prefer; 
                however, certain features of this site might not work without cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.2 "Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are 
                used to improve navigation, block visitors from providing information 
                where inappropriate (the Services "remembers" previous entries of age or 
                country of origin that were outside the specified parameters and blocks 
                subsequent changes), and collect aggregate statistical information on 
                the Services. They are erased once you exit your Web browser or 
                otherwise turn off your computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.3 "Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information 
                that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless 
                you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your 
                computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain 
                information you have previously provided, helping to determine what 
                areas of the Services you may find most valuable, and customizing the 
                Services based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent 
                cookies placed by this site in your computer do not hold personal 
                information.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.4 You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all 
                cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can 
                decide each time whether to accept it. To learn more about cookies and 
                how to specify your preferences, please search for "cookie" in the 
                "Help" portion of your browser. 
            </p>
            <p>
                3.5 An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number assigned to 
                your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the 
                Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable 
                information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing 
                each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a 
                particular user's computer). The IP address can be used to diagnose 
                problems with a server, report aggregate information, determine the 
                fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to a site, and 
                administer and improve the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.6 "Internet tags" (also known as Web Beacons, single-pixel 
                GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than 
                cookies and tell the Web site server information such as the IP address 
                and browser type related to the visitor's computer. Tags may be placed 
                both on online advertisements that bring people to the Services and on 
                different pages of the Services. Such tags indicate how many times a 
                page is opened and which information is consulted.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.7 "Navigational data" (log files, server logs, and clickstream 
                data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the 
                Services, market research purposes, and to communicate information to 
                visitors.

                <br>
                The Services may make full use of passively collected anonymous

                information to provide better service to Service users, customize the 
                Services based on your preferences, compile and analyze statistics and 
                trends, and otherwise administer and improve the Services for your use. We 
                reserve the right to share this anonymous, passive information in 
                aggregated form.

                about your visits to this and other websites (not including your name,

                serving 3rd Party Behavioral Ads. These 3rd Party Behavioral Ads do not 
                identify you personally. Instead, they associate your behavioral data on 
                visited sites with your browser, so that the ads your computer sees on 
                this site are more likely to be relevant to your interests. 3rd Party 
                Behavioral Ads require that that you be served with a cookie containing 
                a tracking code. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the 
                appropriate settings on your browser; however, please note that if you 
                do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this site.

                5.2 We reserve the right to participate in Google's AdSense 
                network for purposes of serving 3rd Party Behavioral Ads. Google uses 
                DoubleClick's DART cookie for serving 3rd Party Behavioral Ads over the 
                AdSense network. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie. For

                We reserve the right to use analytics services provided by 
                third parties. These services use 3rd party cookies to collect 
                anonymous, passive information about your use of this site (see 
                explanation of cookies in Collection of Anonymous, Passive Information 
                above). We use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use 
                of the Services, compiling reports on activity, and providing other 
                services. These web analytics services may also transfer this

                such third parties process the information on the service's behalf.

                We will ask you for personal information when you sign up for any
