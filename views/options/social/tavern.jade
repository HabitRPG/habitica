                | Welcome to the Tavern! Stay a while and meet the locals. If you need to rest (going on vacation? sudden illness?), I'll set you up at the inn - Dailies won't hurt you while you're resting.

      | Whilst resting, your dailies are saved and aren't affected by day turn-over. Whether you check out tomorrow or in a week's time, you'll continue in the same state as when you checked in.
