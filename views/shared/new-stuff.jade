      h5 Increased Gems For Contributors
      p When we first started rewarding contributors, we decided to give them 2 gems per contributor tier. Since then, however, we've introduced many more things to buy, so we've decided to increase this number. All contributors now receive 3 gems/tier for tiers 1-3, and then 4 gems/tier for tiers 4-7, bringing the total number of gems you can earn by contributing to the site to 25.
      p If you've already contributed, you've been given the gems that you're owed according to the new system. (For example, if you are a tier 3 contributor, you received 6 gems in the past and would receive 9 gems under the new system, so you've been awarded 3 gems to account for the difference.)

      p "We are the lost citizens of Dilatory!" explains their leader, Manta. "When Dilatory sank, the Mantis Shrimp that lived in these waters used a spell to transform us into merpeople so that we could survive. But in its rage, the Dread Drag'on trapped us all in the dark crevasse. We have been imprisoned there for hundreds of years - but now at last we are free to rebuild our city!"

      p If you don’t want the 900 XP and 90 Gold, you can delete it using Settings > Site >Fix Character Values. You can also keep it as an apology from the devs for all the confusion! Do whatever is most motivating for you :) It will be granted again when the Drag'on is truly vanquished.

      p Dark shining eyes. Ancient scales. Massive jaws, and flashing teeth. We've awoken something horrifying from the crevasse: **the Dread Drag'on of Dilatory!** Screaming Habiticans fled in all directions when it reared out of the sea, its terrifyingly long neck extending hundreds of feet out of the water as it shattered windows with its searing roar.
      p "This must be what dragged Dilatory down!" yells Lemoness. "It wasn't the weight of the neglected tasks - the Dark Red Dailies just attracted its attention!"
      p "It's surging with magical energy!" @Baconsaur cries. "To have lived this long, it must be able to heal itself! How can we defeat it?"
      p Why, the same way we defeat all beasts - with productivity! Quickly, Habitica, band together and strike through your tasks, and all of us will battle this monster together. (There's no need to abandon previous quests -  we believe in your ability to double-strike!) It won't attack us individually, but the more Dailies we skip, the closer we get to triggering its Neglect Strike - and I don't like the way it's eyeing the Tavern....

      h5 Summer Splash Event: The Lost City Of Dilatory!
      p Dilatory was a lovely island city of ancient Habitica. It was a prosperous place, but as the wealth of the city grew, the inHabitants grew lazy and procrastinated on their Dailies and To-Dos... until the combined weight of their dark red tasks triggered a massive earthquake that sunk the city. Legends say that all of the inHabitants were transformed into sea creatures.

Daniel the Innkeeper has opened a beachside tavern, and Alex is also selling by the shore! Meanwhile, Justin the Guide is giving tours aboard boats, Ian is dispensing quest wisdom from the deep ocean, Matt has opened stables for aquatic pets, and I am swimming about keeping everyone informed!
      h5 But what caused the Earthquake?

      p Hiya, folks! I'm Mrs. Carrot the Carroty Carrot, and I am your new announcer here at HabitRPG! I'm pleased to say that we've released several important updates that we are convinced will drastically improve user experience. Be sure to click around to admire our completely warranted and not at all arbitrary changes! In short, we were worried that the fantasy role-playing-game theme was getting somewhat overplayed, so we've decided unanimously to take the app in a different, more nutritious direction.

h5 The Rewrite! (Mid August)
table.table.table-striped

    td.
      Hello my Habiteers! I have some amazing news to share with you, it's huge!
       Has Habit ever crashed for you? (Joke). Well we <u><a target='_blank' href="http://habitrpg.tumblr.com/post/59104876969/website-issues-what-were-doing">re-wrote the website</a></u> from the ground up
       to conquor those critical bugs once and for all (more from Tyler in a bit). If you haven't seen me for a while (due to a bug in the old site), be sure to catch up with me on the right side of the screen for any missed news. Importantly:
       <a target='_blank' href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ocdevel.habitrpg'>Android</a> & <a target='_blank' href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/habitrpg/id689569235?mt=8'>iOS</a> Apps are out!</u>
  tr
    td.
      They're open source, so help us make them awesome. As for the rewrite: not all features are yet ported, but don't worry - you're still getting drops and streak-bonuses in the background, even if you can't see them yet.
       We'll be working hard to bring in all the missing features. And if you're not already, be sure to follow our updates on <a href="http://habitrpg.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> (there are some fun member highlights recently). One more thing: if you are a Veteran of the old site, I have granted you a Veteran Wolf! Check your inventory :)
  tr
    td.
      JavaScript developers! To me! We must finish vanquishing the old site, as not all features have been ported.
       We rewrote Habit on <a target='_blank' href='http://angularjs.org/'>AngularJS</a> + <a target='_blank' href='http://expressjs.com/'>Express</a>.
       We desparately need your help porting <a href='http://goo.gl/jYWTwl' target='_blank'>the rest of the features</a>, and polishing off the bugs. <a target='_blank' href='http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Contributing_to_HabitRPG'>Read this guide</a> to getting started.
