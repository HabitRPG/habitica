              You've unlocked Rebirth! This special Market item allows you to begin a new game at level 1 while keeping your tasks, achievements, pets, and more. Use it to breathe new life into HabitRPG if you feel you've achieved it all, or to experience new features with the fresh eyes of a beginning character!

        p Rebirth starts your character over from Level 1, as if you had created a new account.
        br
        p Your adventure begins anew with a clean slate:
        .unordered
            li You return to full Health.
            li You have no Experience, Gold, or equipment.
            li Your Habits, Dailies, and To-Dos reset to yellow, and streaks reset.
            li You have the starting class of Warrior until you earn a new class.
        br
        p Your new character inherits a few things from their predecessor:
        .unordered
            li Tasks, history, and settings remain.
            li Challenge, Guild, and Party memberships remain.
            li Gems, backer tiers, and contributor levels remain.
            li Items obtained from Gems or drops (such as pets and mounts) remain, though you cannot access them until you unlock them again.
        br
        .achievement-sun.pull-left(style='margin-right: 5px')
        p You also earn an Achievement for beginning a new adventure!
