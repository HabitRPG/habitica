      Fortify will return all your tasks to a neutral (yellow) state, as if you'd just added them, and top your Health
      off to full. Consider this an option of last resort! Red tasks provide good incentive to improve. But if all that
      red fills you with despair, and the beginning of each new day proves lethal, spend the Gems and catch a reprieve!
