          Hello my Habiteers! I have some amazing news to share with you, it's huge!
           Has Habit ever crashed for you? (Joke). Well we <u><a target='_blank' href="http://habitrpg.tumblr.com/post/59104876969/website-issues-what-were-doing">re-wrote the website</a></u> from the ground up
           to conquor those critical bugs once and for all (more from Tyler in a bit). If you haven't seen me for a while (due to a bug in the old site), be sure to catch up with me on the right side of the screen for any missed news. Importantly:
           <a target='_blank' href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ocdevel.habitrpg'>Android</a> & <a target='_blank' href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/habitrpg/id689569235?mt=8'>iOS</a> Apps are out!</u>
      tr
        td.
          They're open source, so help us make them awesome. As for the rewrite: not all features are yet ported, but don't worry - you're still getting drops and streak-bonuses in the background, even if you can't see them yet.
           We'll be working hard to bring in all the missing features. And if you're not already, be sure to follow our updates on <a href="http://habitrpg.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> (there are some fun member highlights recently). One more thing: if you are a Veteran of the old site, I have granted you a Veteran Wolf! Check your inventory :)
      tr
        td.
          JavaScript developers! To me! We must finish vanquishing the old site, as not all features have been ported.
           We rewrote Habit on <a target='_blank' href='http://angularjs.org/'>AngularJS</a> + <a target='_blank' href='http://expressjs.com/'>Express</a>.
           We desparately need your help porting <a href='http://goo.gl/jYWTwl' target='_blank'>the rest of the features</a>, and polishing off the bugs. <a target='_blank' href='http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Contributing_to_HabitRPG'>Read this guide</a> to getting started.
