    p Hey all, Tyler here. Sorry for the rocky numbers (Exp, GP, etc) with the Class System roll-out! We're tweaking the math today, and things should be mostly finalized by tomorrow. <a target='_blank' href='https://trello.com/c/L1H6LiZ3/110-character-stats-attributes-the-class-system'>Follow our progress here</a>, and please do chime in!
    br
    p We've also changed classes to unlock at lvl 10 instead of 5, to prevent overwhelming our new users. And since users have expressed confusion, we'll be improving UI and clarifification. Stay tuned.
    br
    p iOS users, iTunes is on vacation until 12/28. Until we can push the updated app, you'll need to sync periodically to get the corrected numbers (app has old math, server saves the correct numbers). Android goes out ASAP.

           to conquor those critical bugs once and for all (more from Tyler in a bit). If you haven't seen me for a while (due to a bug in the old site), be sure to catch up with me on the right side of the screen for any missed news. Importantly:
           <a target='_blank' href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ocdevel.habitrpg'>Android</a> & <a target='_blank' href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/habitrpg/id689569235?mt=8'>iOS</a> Apps are out!</u>
      tr
        td.
          They're open source, so help us make them awesome. As for the rewrite: not all features are yet ported, but don't worry - you're still getting drops and streak-bonuses in the background, even if you can't see them yet.
           We'll be working hard to bring in all the missing features. And if you're not already, be sure to follow our updates on <a href="http://habitrpg.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> (there are some fun member highlights recently). One more thing: if you are a Veteran of the old site, I have granted you a Veteran Wolf! Check your inventory :)

           We desparately need your help porting <a href='http://goo.gl/jYWTwl' target='_blank'>the rest of the features</a>, and polishing off the bugs. <a target='_blank' href='http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Contributing_to_HabitRPG'>Read this guide</a> to getting started.
