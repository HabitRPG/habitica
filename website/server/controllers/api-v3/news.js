        <h3>Gift a Subscription and Get One Free!</h3>
        <p>In honor of the season of giving--and due to popular demand!--we're bringing back a very special promotion from today through January 15. Now when you gift somebody a subscription, you get the same subscription for yourself for free!</p>
        <p>Subscribers get tons of perks every month, including exclusive items, the ability to buy Gems with Gold, a cute exclusive Jackalope Pet, and increased data history. Plus, it helps keep Habitica running :) To gift a subscription to someone, just open their profile and click the present icon in the upper right. You can open their profile by clicking their avatar in your party header or their name in chat.</p>
        <p>This promotion is only available on <a href='https://habitica.com/'>the web</a> for now, but it will be coming to the Habitica mobile apps very soon.</p>
        <p>Please note that this promotion only applies when you gift to another Habitican. If you or your gift recipient already have a recurring subscription, the gifted subscription will only start after that subscription is cancelled or has expired. Thanks so much for your support! <3</p>
