These Challenges are designed to help you build and maintain goals that are destined for success and then stick with them as the year progresses. For this month's Challenge, <a href='/challenges/00bbaeaa-d4e0-4eab-92e8-78ba1e754229'>Reach for Your First Achievement</a>, we're focusing on setting smaller mini-goals as milestones! It has a 15 Gem prize, which will be awarded to five lucky winners on April 1st.</p>

        <p>The next Take This Challenge has also launched, "<a href='/challenges/7d199231-f3de-4d93-9765-06392f521e96'>Do One Thing Well!</a>", with a focus on minimizing multitasking. Be sure to check it out to earn additional pieces of the Take This armor set!</p>
        <p><a href='http://www.takethis.org/' target='_blank'>Take This</a> is a nonprofit that seeks to inform the gamer community about mental health issues, to provide education about mental disorders and mental illness prevention, and to reduce the stigma of mental illness.</p>
