            <p>Oh no! That dastardly April Fool seems to have pulled off his "small" prank: all our pets and mounts have shrunk!</p>
            <p>"Haha!" the April Fool laughs as he bursts in the the Tavern, "Enjoy your new and more efficiently-sized friends! Now your pets and mounts are so much easier to keep track of, right? This should certainly increase your productivity!"</p>

        <p>Lady Glaciate grumbles from her corner table and looks at her mammoth, which is happily cavorting in her teacup. "Well, since I don't have a ride back home to the Stoikalm Steppes at the moment, I disagree."</p>
        <p>As Sir Stomp sprays tea triumphantly from his trunk, a small smile tugs at the corner of her mouth. ".â€¦I suppose one could argue it's quite cute, though," she grudgingly adds.</p>
        <p>It looks like all our pets and mounts are extra small for the time being. Enjoy the fun by checking out everyone's profiles today! Your pets and mounts will return to normal on April 3.</p>
