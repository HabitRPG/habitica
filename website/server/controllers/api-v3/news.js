            <h3>February 2018 Resolution Success Challenge and Take This Challenge</h3>
            <p>The Habitica team has launched a special official Challenge series hosted in the <a href="/groups/guild/6e6a8bd3-9f5f-4351-9188-9f11fcd80a99">Official New Year's Resolution Guild</a>.

For this month's Challenge, <a href="/challenges/2836b401-a11d-4fe9-a75f-77c1e9d31ba4">Hone your Weapons</a>, we're focusing on making sure the goals you've set this year are specific and achievable!

        <h3>Updates and Fixes</h3>
        <p>We've made a number of fixes, most prominently a bunch of fixes for notifications so that they direct you to the correct place when clicked and disappear after that!</p>
        <p>We've also fixed the issue where some Habiticans were seeing old announcements from Bailey rather than the latest ones, and we've added a way for Group Plan managers to note when an assigned task needs further work from the assignee.</p>
        <p>We hope these fixes improve your Habitica experience!</p>
