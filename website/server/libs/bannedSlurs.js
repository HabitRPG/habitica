// CONTENT WARNING:
// This file contains slurs on race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.
// Do not read this file if you do not want to be exposed to those words.
// The words are stored in an array called `bannedSlurs` which is then exported with `module.exports = bannedSlurs;`
// This file does not contain any other code.





















































// Some words that are slurs in English are not included here because they are valid words in other languages and so must not cause an automatic mute.
// See the comments in bannedWords.js for details.

// 'tards' is currently not in this list because it's causing a problem for French speakers - it's commonly used within French words after an accented 'e' which the word blocker's regular expression treats as a word boundary
