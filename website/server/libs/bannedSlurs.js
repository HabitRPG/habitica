// CONTENT WARNING:
// This file contains slurs on race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.
// Do not read this file if you do not want to be exposed to those words.
// The words are stored in an array called `bannedSlurs` which is then exported with `module.exports = bannedSlurs;`
// This file does not contain any other code.
//
//
// EDIT WARNING:
//
// If you think this file needs to be changed please do NOT create a
// pull request or issue in GitHub!
// Email admin@habitica.com to discuss the change you want made.
//
// All updates to this file must be done through a direct commit to limit
// the words visibility in GitHub to protect our coders, socialites, and
// wiki editors who look through PRs for information.
//
// When adding words that contain asterisks, put two backslashes before them.
//
// Do NOT enter any words with $ signs. E.g., "i$$" cannot be on the list
// because it would cause the word "I" to be blocked. Escaping $ signs with
// backslashes doesn't work.






















































// Some words that are slurs in English are not included here because they are valid words in other languages and so must not cause an automatic mute.
// See the comments in bannedWords.js for details.

// 'spic' should not be banned because it's often used in the phrase "spic and span"
// 'tards' is currently not in this list because it's causing a problem for French speakers - it's commonly used within French words after an accented 'e' which the word blocker's regular expression treats as a word boundary


// DO NOT EDIT! See the comments at the top of this file.
