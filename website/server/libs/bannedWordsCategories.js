// CONTENT WARNING:
//
// This file contains slurs, swear words, religious oaths, and words related
// to addictive substance and adult topics.
// Do not read this file if you do not want to be exposed to those words.
//
// The words are stored in an array called `bannedWords` which is then
// exported with `module.exports = bannedWords;`
// This file does not contain any other code.
//
//
// EDIT WARNING:
//
// If you think this file needs to be changed please do NOT create a
// pull request or issue in GitHub!
// Email admin@habitica.com to discuss the change you want made.
//
// All updates to this file must be done through a direct commit to limit
// the words visibility in GitHub to protect our coders, socialites, and
// wiki editors who look through PRs for information.
//
// When adding words that contain asterisks, put two backslashes before them.
//
// Do NOT enter any words with $ signs. E.g., "i$$" cannot be on the list
// because it would cause the word "I" to be blocked. Escaping $ signs with
// backslashes doesn't work.
