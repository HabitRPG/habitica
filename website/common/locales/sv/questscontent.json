Stooping near the water to get a drink, you stumble back in shock as a massive hippopotamus rises. “Resting so soon? Don’t be so lazy, get back to work.” You try and protest that you’ve been working hard and need a break, but the hippo isn’t having any of it.<br><br>@khdarkwolf whispers to you, “Notice how it’s lounging around all day but has the nerve to call you lazy?

    "questLostMasterclasser1Notes": "You’re unexpectedly summoned by @beffymaroo and @Lemoness to Habit Hall, where you’re astonished to find all four of Habitica’s Masterclassers awaiting you in the wan light of dawn. Even the Joyful Reaper looks somber.<br><br>“Oho, you’re here,” says the April Fool. “Now, we would not rouse you from your rest without a truly dire—”<br><br>“Help us investigate the recent bout of possessions,” interrupts Lady Glaciate. “All the victims blamed someone named Tzina.”<br><br>The April Fool is clearly affronted by the summary. “What about my speech?” he hisses to her. “With the fog and thunderstorm effects?”<br><br>“We’re in a hurry,” she mutters back. “And my mammoths are still soggy from your incessant practicing.”<br><br>“I’m afraid that the esteemed Master of Warriors is correct,” says King Manta. “Time is of the essence. Will you aid us?”<br><br>When you nod, he waves his hands to open a portal, revealing an underwater room. “Swim down with me to Dilatory, and we will scour my library for any references that might give us a clue.” At your look of confusion, he adds, “Don’t worry, the paper was enchanted long before Dilatory sank. None of the books are the slightest bit damp!” He winks.“Unlike Lady Glaciate’s mammoths.”<br><br>“I heard that, Manta.”<br><br>As you dive into the water after the Master of Mages, your legs magically fuse into fins. Though your body is buoyant, your heart sinks when you see the thousands of bookshelves. Better start reading…",
    "questLostMasterclasser1Completion": "After hours of poring through volumes, you still haven’t found any useful information.<br><br>“It seems impossible that there isn’t even the tiniest reference to anything relevant,” says head librarian @Tuqjoi, and their assistant @stefalupagus nods in frustration.<br><br>King Manta’s eyes narrow. “Not impossible…” he says. “<em>Intentional</em>.” For a moment, the water glows around his hands, and several of the books shudder. “Something is obscuring information,” he says. “Not just a static spell, but something with a will of its own. Something… alive.” He swims up from the table. “The Joyful Reaper needs to hear about this. Let’s pack a meal for the road.”",

    "questLostMasterclasser2Notes": "The Joyful Reaper drums her bony fingers on some of the books that you brought. “Oh, dear,” the Master of Healers says. “There is a malevolent life essence at work. I might have guessed, considering the attacks by reanimated skulls during each incident.” Her assistant @tricksy.fox brings in a chest, and you are startled to see the contents that @beffymaroo unloads: the very same objects once used by this mysterious Tzina to possess people.<br><br>“I’m going to use resonant healing magic to try to make this creature manifest,” the Joyful Reaper says, reminding you that the skeleton is a somewhat unconventional Healer. “You’ll need to read the revealed information quickly, in case it breaks loose.”<br><br>As she concentrates, a twisting mist begins to siphon from the books and twine around the objects. Quickly, you flip through the pages, trying to read the new lines of text that are writhing into view. You catch only a few snippets: “Sands of the Timewastes” — “the Great Disaster” —“split into four”— “permanently corrupted”— before a single name catches your eye: Zinnya.<br><br>Abruptly, the pages wrench free from your fingers and shred themselves as a howling creature explodes into being, coalescing around the possessed objects.<br><br>“It’s an a’Voidant!” the Joyful Reaper shouts, throwing up a protection spell. “They’re ancient creatures of confusion and obscurity. If this Tzina can control one, she must have a frightening command over life magic. Quickly, attack it before it escapes back into the books!”<br><br>",
    "questLostMasterclasser2Completion": "The a’Voidant succumbs at last, and you share the snippets that you read.<br><br>“None of those references sound familiar, even for someone as old as I,” the Joyful Reaper says. “Except… the Timewastes are a distant desert at the most hostile edge of Habitica. Portals often fail nearby, but swift mounts could get you there in no time. Lady Glaciate will be glad to assist.” Her voice grows amused. “Which means that the enamored Master of Rogues will undoubtedly tag along.” She hands you the glimmering mask. “Perhaps you should try to track the lingering magic in these items to its source. I’ll go harvest some sustenance for your journey.”",

    "questLostMasterclasser3Notes": "As night unfurls over the scorching sands of the Timewastes, your guides @AnnDeLune, @Kiwibot, and @Katy133 lead you forward. Some bleached pillars poke from the shadowed dunes, and as you approach them, a strange skittering sound echoes across the seemingly-abandoned expanse.<br><br>“Invisible creatures!” says the April Fool, clearly covetous. “Oho! Just imagine the possibilities. This must be the work of a truly stealthy Rogue.”<br><br>“A Rogue who could be watching us,” says Lady Glaciate, dismounting and raising her spear. “If there’s a head-on attack, try not to irritate our opponent. I don’t want a repeat of the volcano incident.”<br><br>He beams at her. “But it was one of your most resplendent rescues.”<br><br>To your surprise, Lady Glaciate turns very pink at the compliment. She hastily stomps away to examine the ruins.<br><br>“Looks like the wreck of an ancient city,” says @AnnDeLune. “I wonder what…”<br><br>Before she can finish her sentence, a portal roars open in the sky. Wasn’t that magic supposed to be nearly impossible here? The hoofbeats of the invisible animals thunder as they flee in panic, and you steady yourself against the onslaught of shrieking skulls that flood the skies.",
    "questLostMasterclasser3Completion": "The April Fool surprises the final skull with a spray of sand, and it blunders backwards into Lady Glaciate, who smashes it expertly. As you catch your breath and look up, you see a single flash of someone’s silhouette moving on the other side of the closing portal. Thinking quickly, you snatch up the amulet from the chest of previously-possessed items, and sure enough, it’s drawn towards the unseen person. Ignoring the shouts of alarm from Lady Glaciate and the April Fool, you leap through the portal just as it snaps shut, plummeting into an inky swath of nothingness.",

These four are a mockery, each possessing only a fragment of what I once had! I commanded every spell and learned every skill. I shaped your very world to my whim — until the traitorous aether itself collapsed under the weight of my talents and my perfectly reasonable expectations. I have been trapped for millennia in this resulting void, recuperating. Imagine my disgust when I learned how my legacy had been corrupted.” She lets out a low, echoing laugh. “My plan was to destroy their domains before destroying them, but I suppose the order is irrelevant.” With a burst of uncanny strength, she charges forward, and the Realm of Void explodes into chaos.",
    "questLostMasterclasser4Completion": "Under the onslaught of your final attack, the Lost Masterclasser screams in frustration, her body flickering into translucence. The thrashing void stills around her as she slumps forward, and for a moment, she seems to change, becoming younger, calmer, with an expression of peace upon her face… but then everything melts away with scarcely a whisper, and you’re kneeling once more in the desert sand.<br><br>“It seems that we have much to learn about our own history,” King Manta says, staring at the broken ruins. “After the Master Aethermancer grew overwhelmed and lost control of her abilities, the outpouring of void must have leached the life from the entire land. Everything probably became deserts like this.”<br><br>“No wonder the ancients who founded Habitica stressed a balance of productivity and wellness,” the Joyful Reaper murmurs. “Rebuilding their world would have been a daunting task requiring considerable hard work, but they would have wanted to prevent such a catastrophe from happening again.”<br><br>“Oho, look at those formerly possessed items!” says the April Fool. Sure enough, all of them shimmer with a pale, glimmering translucence from the final burst of aether released when you laid Anti’zinnya’s spirit to rest. “What a dazzling effect. I must take notes.”<br><br>“The concentrated remnants of aether in this area probably caused caused these animals to go invisible, too,” says Lady Glaciate, scratching a patch of emptiness behind the ears. You feel an unseen fluffy head nudge your hand, and suspect that you’ll have to do some explaining at the Stables back home. As you look at the ruins one last time, you spot all that remains of the first Masterclasser: her shimmering cloak. Lifting it onto your shoulders, you head back to Habit City, pondering everything that you have learned.<br><br>",
