    "faqQuestion3": "為什麼我的任務會改變顏色？",
    "iosFaqAnswer3": "你的任務會改變顏色是因為你完成該任務的次數比較多！每一個新任務都是從黃色開始。當你完成每日任務或是好習慣時，它們就會轉變成藍色。如果沒有完成每日任務或是你做了壞習慣時，它們就會轉變成紅色。越是紅的任務被正向完成時，就能得到越多獎勵。但是如果你又負向完成的話，它所給予的傷害也就越多喔！這有助於你完成比較困難的任務！",

    "faqQuestion4": "為什麼我的角色生命值減少，我要怎麼回復？",
    "iosFaqAnswer4": "有很多方式都會減少角色的生命值。第一，如果你沒有如期完成每日任務的話，角色會在隔天受到傷害。第二，如果你做了壞習慣，它也會使生命值受損。最後，若你正在隊伍裡並且處於活動任務捲軸狀態的話，如果隊友沒有乖乖完成他自己的每日任務，那麼任務魔王也會攻擊你喔。\n\n主要回復生命值的方法就是提升等級，當你升等就會自動補足生命值。你也可以用金幣購買獎勵框框裡的治療藥水。另外，當你等級大於或等於10時，你可以選擇成為醫者，這樣一來你就能夠學習治癒術。或者你的隊伍中 (「社交」> 「隊伍」)，有人是醫者的話，可以請他們治療你喔。",

    "webFaqAnswer4": "There are several things that can cause you to take damage. First, if you left Dailies incomplete overnight and didn't check them off in the screen that popped up the next morning, those unfinished Dailies will damage you. Second, if you click a bad Habit, it will damage you. Finally, if you are in a Boss Battle with your party and one of your party mates did not complete all their Dailies, the Boss will attack you. The main way to heal is to gain a level, which restores all your Health. You can also buy a Health Potion with Gold from the Rewards column. Plus, at level 10 or above, you can choose to become a Healer, and then you will learn healing skills. Other Healers can heal you as well if you are in a Party with them.

    "iosFaqAnswer7": "在等級10的時候，你可以選擇成為戰士、法師、盜賊或是醫者。(所有玩家在一開始都會被系統默認為是戰士直到你升等為10。) 每種職業都有各自的優點以及不同的裝備選擇，當你等級11時還能夠施放職業技能。戰士可以很輕鬆地擊退魔王，還能夠抵擋來自任務的傷害，同時也是隊伍攻擊主力。法師也能夠給予魔王有效的攻擊，等級提升快速且能夠幫助隊伍的成員補充魔力。盜賊能獲得最多金幣，也是能撿到最多掉落物品的職業，而這些優點也能回饋給隊伍。最後是醫者，醫者擁有特殊技能可以治癒他們自身以及隊伍成員的生命值。\n\n如果你還沒能夠決定該選擇哪種作為職業的話--舉例，如果你覺得與其馬上選擇職業，不如先補足目前所需的裝備的話--你可以點選「之後再決定」，等你覺得時機到了就可以到「選單」>「選擇職業」。",

Warriors can easily damage Bosses, withstand more damage from their tasks, and help make their Party tougher. Mages can also easily damage Bosses, as well as level up quickly and restore Mana for their party. Rogues earn the most gold and find the most item drops, and they can help their Party do the same. Finally, Healers can heal themselves and their Party members.\n\n If you don't want to choose a Class immediately -- for example, if you are still working to buy all the gear of your current class -- you can click “Opt Out” and choose later under Menu > Choose Class.",

    "iosFaqAnswer8": "當你等級10的時候，除了能夠選擇職業外，還會出現一條藍色的狀態列，它是你的魔力值。當你繼續升等後，你還會陸續解鎖一些特殊的職業技能，使用技能會使你的魔力減少。每種職業都有各自獨特的技能，當等級11時你會在「選單」>「使用技能」內找到它們。魔力值不像生命值一樣會隨著你等級提升而補滿，它會因為你完成好習慣、每日任務和待辦事項而增加，也會因為你做了壞習慣而減少。順帶一提，每隔一天魔力值也會悄悄回復一點，當你完成越多每日任務，隔天也能補充越多魔力值喔。",
