    "commGuidePara017": "<strong>Respect each other.</strong> Be courteous, kind, friendly, and helpful. Remember: Habiticans come from all backgrounds and have had wildly divergent experiences. This is part of what makes Habitica so cool! Building a community means respecting and celebrating our differences as well as our similarities. Here are some easy ways to respect each other:",
    "commGuideList02A": "<strong>Obey all of the Terms and Conditions.</strong>",
    "commGuideList02B": "<strong>Do not post images or text that are violent, threatening, or sexually explicit/suggestive, or that promote discrimination, bigotry, racism, sexism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group.</strong> Not even as a joke. This includes slurs as well as statements. Not everyone has the same sense of humour, and so something that you consider a joke may be hurtful to another. Attack your Dailies, not each other.",
    "commGuideList02C": "<strong>Keep discussions appropriate for all ages.</strong> We have many young Habiticans who use the site! Let's not tarnish any innocents or hinder any Habiticans in their goals.",
    "commGuideList02D": "<strong>Avoid profanity.</strong> This includes milder, religious-based oaths that may be acceptable elsewhere-we have people from all religious and cultural backgrounds, and we want to make sure that all of them feel comfortable in public spaces. Additionally, slurs will be dealt with very severely, as they are also a violation of the Terms of Service.",
    "commGuideList02E": "<strong>Avoid extended discussions of divisive topics outside of the Back Corner.</strong> If you feel that someone has said something rude or hurtful, do not engage them. A single, polite comment, such as \"That joke makes me feel uncomfortable,\" is fine, but being harsh or unkind in response to harsh or unkind comments heightens tensions and makes Habitica a more negative space. Kindness and politeness helps others understand where you are coming from.",
    "commGuideList02F": "<strong>Comply immediately with any Mod request</strong> to cease a discussion or move it to the Back Corner. Last words, parting shots and conclusive zingers should all be delivered (courteously) at your \"table\" in the Back Corner, if allowed.",
    "commGuideList02G": "<strong>Take time to reflect instead of responding in anger</strong> if someone tells you that something you said or did made them uncomfortable. There is great strength in being able to sincerely apologise to someone. If you feel that the way they responded to you was inappropriate, contact a mod rather than calling them out on it publicly.",
    "commGuideList02H": "<strong>Divisive/contentious conversations should be reported to mods.</strong> If you feel that a conversation is getting heated, overly emotional, or hurtful, cease to engage. Instead, email <a href=\"mailto:leslie@habitica.com\">leslie@habitica.com</a> to let us know about it. It's our job to keep you safe.",
    "commGuideList02I": "<strong>Do not spam.</strong> Spamming may include, but is not limited to: posting the same comment or query in multiple places, posting links without explanation or context, posting nonsensical messages, or posting many messages in a row. Asking for gems or a subscription in any of the chat spaces or via Private Message is also considered spamming.",
    "commGuidePara019": "<strong>In private spaces,</strong> users have more freedom to discuss whatever topics they would like, but they still may not violate the Terms and Conditions, including posting any discriminatory, violent, or threatening content. Note that, because Challenge names appear in the winner's public profile, ALL Challenge names must obey the public space guidelines, even if they appear in a private space.",
    "commGuidePara020": "Private Messages (PMs) have some additional guidelines. If someone has blocked you, do not contact them elsewhere to ask them to unblock you. Additionally, you should not send PMs to someone asking for support (since public answers to support questions are helpful to the community). Finally, do not send anyone PMs begging for a gift of gems or a subscription, as this can be considered spamming.",
    "commGuidePara021": "Furthermore, some public spaces in Habitica have additional guidelines.",
    "commGuideHeadingTavern": "The Tavern",
    "commGuidePara022": "The Tavern is the main spot for Habiticans to mingle. Daniel the Barkeep keeps the place spic-and-span, and Lemoness will happily conjure up some lemonade while you sit and chat. Just keep in mind...",
    "commGuidePara023": "Conversation tends to revolve around casual chatting and productivity or life improvement tips.",
    "commGuidePara024": "Because the Tavern chat can only hold 200 messages, <strong>it isn't a good place for prolonged conversations on topics, especially sensitive ones</strong> (ex. politics, religion, depression, whether or not goblin-hunting should be banned, etc.). These conversations should be taken to an applicable guild or the Back Corner (more information below).",
    "commGuidePara027": "<strong>Don't discuss anything addictive in the Tavern.</strong> Many people use Habitica to try to quit their bad Habits. Hearing people talk about addictive/illegal substances may make this much harder for them! Respect your fellow Tavern-goers and take this into consideration. This includes, but is not exclusive to: smoking, alcohol, pornography, gambling, and drug use/abuse.",
    "commGuideHeadingPublicGuilds": "Public Guilds",
    "commGuidePara029": "<strong>Public guilds are much like the Tavern, except that instead of being centered around general conversation, they have a focused theme.</strong> Public guild chat should focus on this theme. For example, members of the Wordsmiths guild might be cross if they found the conversation suddenly focusing on gardening instead of writing, and a Dragon-Fanciers guild might not have any interest in deciphering ancient runes. Some guilds are more lax about this than others, but in general, <strong>try to stay on topic!</strong>",
    "commGuidePara031": "<strong>Some public guilds will contain sensitive topics such as depression, religion, politics, etc.</strong> This is fine as long as the conversations therein do not violate any of the Terms and Conditions or Public Space Rules, and as long as they stay on topic.",
    "commGuidePara033": "<strong>Public Guilds may NOT contain 18+ content. If they plan to regularly discuss sensitive content, they should say so in the Guild title.</strong> This is to keep Habitica safe and comfortable for everyone. If the guild in question has different kinds of sensitive issues, it is respectful to your fellow Habiticans to place your comment behind a warning (ex. \"Warning: references self-harm\"). Additionally, the sensitive material should be topical—bringing up self-harm in a guild focused on fighting depression may make sense but may be less appropriate in a music guild. If you see someone who is repeatedly violating this guideline even after several requests, please email <a href=\"mailto:leslie@habitica.com\">leslie@habitica.com</a> with screenshots.",
    "commGuidePara035": "<strong>No Guilds, Public or Private, should be created for the purpose of attacking any group or individual. Creating such a Guild is grounds for an instant ban.</strong> Fight bad habits, not your fellow adventurers!",
    "commGuidePara037": "All Tavern Challenges and Public Guild Challenges must comply with these rules as well.",
    "commGuideHeadingBackCorner": "The Back Corner",
    "commGuidePara038": "<strong>Sometimes a conversation will get too long, off-topic, or sensitive to be continued in a Public Space without making users uncomfortable. In that case, the conversation will be directed to the Back Corner Guild. Note that being directed to the Back Corner is not at all a punishment!</strong> In fact, many Habiticans like to hang out there and discuss things at length.",
    "commGuidePara039": "The Back Corner Guild is a free public space to discuss sensitive material or a single conversation for a long time, and it is carefully moderated. <strong>The Public Space Guidelines still apply, as do all of the Terms and Conditions.</strong> Just because we are wearing long cloaks and clustering in a corner doesn't mean that anything goes! Now pass me that smoldering candle, will you?",

Trello is the system that lends method to our madness. Out of consideration for this, <strong>try your best to contain all your thoughts into one comment, instead of commenting many times in a row on the same card. If you think of something new, feel free to edit your original comments.</strong> Please, take pity on those of us who receive a notification for every new comment. Our inboxes can only withstand so much.",
