    "webFaqAnswer1": "* Good Habits (the ones with a :heavy_plus_sign:) are tasks that you can do many times a day, such as eating vegetables. Bad Habits (the ones with a :heavy_minus_sign:) are tasks that you should avoid, like biting nails. Habits with a :heavy_plus_sign: and a :heavy_minus_sign: have a good choice and a bad choice, like taking the stairs vs. taking the elevator. Good Habits award Experience and Gold. Bad Habits subtract Health.\n* Dailies are tasks that you have to do every day, like brushing your teeth or checking your email. You can adjust the days that a Daily is due by clicking the pencil item to edit it. If you skip a Daily that is due, your avatar will take damage overnight. Be careful not to add too many Dailies at once!\n* To Do's are your To Do list. Completing a To Do earns you Gold and Experience. You never lose Health from To Do's. You can add a due date to a To Do by clicking the pencil icon to edit.",
    "webFaqAnswer3": "Your tasks change colour based on how well you are currently accomplishing them! Each new task starts out as a neutral yellow. Perform Dailies or positive Habits more frequently and they move toward blue. Miss a Daily or give in to a bad Habit and the task moves toward red. The redder a task, the more rewards it will give you, but if it’s a Daily or bad Habit, the more it will hurt you! This helps motivate you to complete the tasks that are giving you trouble.",
    "webFaqAnswer5": "Yes, with Parties! You can start your own Party or join an existing one. Partying with other Habitica players is a great way to take on Quests, receive buffs from Party members’ skills, and boost your motivation with additional accountability.",
    "webFaqAnswer7": "At level 10, you can choose to become a Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Healer. (All players start as Warriors by default.) Each Class has different equipment options, different Skills that they can cast after level 11, and different advantages. Warriors can easily damage Bosses, withstand more damage from their tasks, and help make their party tougher. Mages can also easily damage Bosses, as well as level up quickly and restore Mana for their party. Rogues earn the most Gold and find the most item drops, and they can help their party do the same. Finally, Healers can heal themselves and their party members. If you don't want to choose a Class immediately -- for example, if you are still working to buy all the gear of your current class -- you can click \"Opt Out\" and re-enable it later under Settings.",
    "webFaqAnswer9": "First, you need to join or start a Party by clicking \"Party\" in the navigation bar. Although you can battle monsters alone, we recommend playing in a group, because this will make quests much easier. Plus, having a friend to cheer you on as you accomplish your tasks is very motivating! Next, you need a Quest Scroll, which are stored under Inventory > Quests. There are four ways to get a scroll:\n * When you invite people to your Party, you'll be rewarded with the Basi-List Scroll!\n * At level 15, you get a Quest-line, i.e., three linked quests. More Quest-lines unlock at levels 30, 40, and 60 respectively.\n * You can buy Quests from the Quests Shop (Shops > Quests) for Gold and Gems.\n * When you check in to Habitica a certain number of times, you'll be rewarded with Quest Scrolls. You earn a Scroll during your 1st, 7th, 22nd, and 40th check-ins.\n To battle the Boss or collect items for a Collection Quest, simply complete your tasks normally, and they will be tallied into damage overnight. (Reloading may be required to see the Boss's Health bar go down.) If you are fighting a Boss and you missed any Dailies, the Boss will damage your Party at the same time that you damage the Boss. After level 11 Mages and Warriors will gain Skills that allow them to deal additional damage to the Boss, so these are excellent classes to choose at level 10 if you want to be a heavy hitter.",

    "faqQuestion25": "What are the different task types?",
    "webFaqAnswer25": "Habitica uses three different task types to accommodate your needs: Habits, Dailies, and To Do’s.\n\nHabits can be positive or negative and represent something you may want to track multiple times per day, or on an unset schedule. Positive Habits will provide you with rewards, like Gold and Experience (Exp), while Negative Habits will cause you to lose health points (HP).\n\nDailies are repeated tasks you want to complete on a more structured schedule. E.g. Once per day, three times a week, or four times a month. Missing Dailies causes you to lose HP, but the more difficult they are, the better the rewards!\n\nTo Do’s are one-off tasks that provide rewards after you complete them. To Do’s can have a due date, but you won’t lose HP if you miss it.\n\nPick the task type that best fits what you want to achieve!",
