    "commGuideHeadingWelcome": "歡迎來到Habitica!",
    "commGuidePara001": "Greetings, adventurer! Welcome to Habitica, the land of productivity, healthy living, and the occasional rampaging gryphon. We have a cheerful community full of helpful people supporting each other on their way to self-improvement. To fit in, all it takes is a positive attitude, a respectful manner, and the understanding that everyone has different skills and limitations -- including you! Habiticans are patient with one another and try to help whenever they can.",
    "commGuidePara002": "To help keep everyone safe, happy, and productive in the community, we do have some guidelines. We have carefully crafted them to make them as friendly and easy-to-read as possible. Please take the time to read them before you start chatting.",
    "commGuidePara003": "這些規定適用於我們使用到的所有社群空間,包括(但不限於)Trello,Github,Transifex,還有Wikia(也就是我們的維基百科)。偶爾,會有壹些意想不到的事情發生,例如壹個新的衝突事端的出現或者是壹個惡意搗亂的人.當這些發生的時候,管理員們可能會適當的修改這些準則以確保社區的安全.別擔心，假如指導準則有所更動，Bailey 會發布公告來通知妳。",
    "commGuideHeadingInteractions": "Interactions in Habitica",
    "commGuidePara015": "Habitica has two kinds of social spaces: public, and private. Public spaces include the Tavern, Public Guilds, GitHub, Trello, and the Wiki. Private spaces are Private Guilds, Party chat, and Private Messages. All Display Names must comply with the public space guidelines. To change your Display Name, go on the website to User > Profile and click on the \"Edit\" button.",
    "commGuidePara016": "當妳在 Habitica 的公共區域四處逛逛時，請務必遵守壹些普通規則，好確保大家的舒服與愉快。對於像妳這樣的冒險者而言，簡直易如反掌！",
    "commGuideList02A": "<strong>Respect each other</strong>. Be courteous, kind, friendly, and helpful. Remember: Habiticans come from all backgrounds and have had wildly divergent experiences. This is part of what makes Habitica so cool! Building a community means respecting and celebrating our differences as well as our similarities. Here are some easy ways to respect each other:",
    "commGuideList02B": "<strong>Obey all of the <a href='/static/terms' target='_blank'>Terms and Conditions</a></strong>.",
    "commGuideList02C": "<strong>Do not post images or text that are violent, threatening, or sexually explicit/suggestive, or that promote discrimination, bigotry, racism, sexism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group</strong>. Not even as a joke. This includes slurs as well as statements. Not everyone has the same sense of humor, and so something that you consider a joke may be hurtful to another. Attack your Dailies, not each other.",
    "commGuideList02D": "<strong>Keep discussions appropriate for all ages</strong>. We have many young Habiticans who use the site! Let's not tarnish any innocents or hinder any Habiticans in their goals.",
    "commGuideList02E": "<strong>Avoid profanity. This includes milder, religious-based oaths that may be acceptable elsewhere</strong>. We have people from all religious and cultural backgrounds, and we want to make sure that all of them feel comfortable in public spaces. <strong>If a moderator or staff member tells you that a term is disallowed on Habitica, even if it is a term that you did not realize was problematic, that decision is final</strong>. Additionally, slurs will be dealt with very severely, as they are also a violation of the Terms of Service.",
    "commGuideList02F": "<strong>Avoid extended discussions of divisive topics in the Tavern and where it would be off-topic</strong>. If you feel that someone has said something rude or hurtful, do not engage them. If someone mentions something that is allowed by the guidelines but which is hurtful to you, it’s okay to politely let someone know that. If it is against the guidelines or the Terms of Service, you should flag it and let a mod respond. When in doubt, flag the post.",
    "commGuideList02G": "<strong>Comply immediately with any Mod request</strong>. This could include, but is not limited to, requesting you limit your posts in a particular space, editing your profile to remove unsuitable content, asking you to move your discussion to a more suitable space, etc.",
    "commGuideList02J": "<strong>Do not spam</strong>. Spamming may include, but is not limited to: posting the same comment or query in multiple places, posting links without explanation or context, posting nonsensical messages, posting multiple promotional messages about a Guild, Party or Challenge, or posting many messages in a row. Asking for gems or a subscription in any of the chat spaces or via Private Message is also considered spamming. If people clicking on a link will result in any benefit to you, you need to disclose that in the text of your message or that will also be considered spam.<br/><br/>It is up to the mods to decide if something constitutes spam or might lead to spam, even if you don’t feel that you have been spamming. For example, advertising a Guild is acceptable once or twice, but multiple posts in one day would probably constitute spam, no matter how useful the Guild is!",
    "commGuideList02K": "<strong>Avoid posting large header text in the public chat spaces, particularly the Tavern</strong>. Much like ALL CAPS, it reads as if you were yelling, and interferes with the comfortable atmosphere.",
    "commGuideList02L": "<strong>We highly discourage the exchange of personal information -- particularly information that can be used to identify you -- in public chat spaces</strong>. Identifying information can include but is not limited to: your address, your email address, and your API token/password. This is for your safety! Staff or moderators may remove such posts at their discretion. If you are asked for personal information in a private Guild, Party, or PM, we highly recommend that you politely refuse and alert the staff and moderators by either 1) flagging the message if it is in a Party or private Guild, or 2) filling out the <a href='http://contact.habitica.com/' target='_blank'>Moderator Contact Form</a> and including screenshots.",
    "commGuidePara019": "<strong>In private spaces</strong>, users have more freedom to discuss whatever topics they would like, but they still may not violate the Terms and Conditions, including posting slurs or any discriminatory, violent, or threatening content. Note that, because Challenge names appear in the winner's public profile, ALL Challenge names must obey the public space guidelines, even if they appear in a private space.",
    "commGuidePara020": "<strong>Private Messages (PMs)</strong> have some additional guidelines. If someone has blocked you, do not contact them elsewhere to ask them to unblock you. Additionally, you should not send PMs to someone asking for support (since public answers to support questions are helpful to the community). Finally, do not send anyone PMs begging for a gift of gems or a subscription, as this can be considered spamming.",
    "commGuidePara020A": "<strong>If you see a post that you believe is in violation of the public space guidelines outlined above, or if you see a post that concerns you or makes you uncomfortable, you can bring it to the attention of Moderators and Staff by clicking the flag icon to report it</strong>. A Staff member or Moderator will respond to the situation as soon as possible. Please note that intentionally reporting innocent posts is an infraction of these Guidelines (see below in “Infractions”). PMs cannot be flagged at this time, so if you need to report a PM, please contact the Mods via the form on the “Contact Us” page, which you can also access via the help menu by clicking “<a href='http://contact.habitica.com/' target='_blank'>Contact the Moderation Team</a>.” You may want to do this if there are multiple problematic posts by the same person in different Guilds, or if the situation requires some explanation. You may contact us in your native language if that is easier for you: we may have to use Google Translate, but we want you to feel comfortable about contacting us if you have a problem.",
    "commGuidePara021": "此外,Habitica中的一些公共区域还有其他的準則。",
    "commGuideHeadingTavern": "酒館",
    "commGuidePara022": "The Tavern is the main spot for Habiticans to mingle. Daniel the Innkeeper keeps the place spic-and-span, and Lemoness will happily conjure up some lemonade while you sit and chat. Just keep in mind…",
    "commGuidePara023": "<strong>Conversation tends to revolve around casual chatting and productivity or life improvement tips</strong>. Because the Tavern chat can only hold 200 messages, <strong>it isn't a good place for prolonged conversations on topics, especially sensitive ones</strong> (ex. politics, religion, depression, whether or not goblin-hunting should be banned, etc.). These conversations should be taken to an applicable Guild.  A Mod may direct you to a suitable Guild, but it is ultimately your responsibility to find and post in the appropriate place.",
    "commGuidePara024": "<strong>Don't discuss anything addictive in the Tavern</strong>. Many people use Habitica to try to quit their bad Habits. Hearing people talk about addictive/illegal substances may make this much harder for them! Respect your fellow Tavern-goers and take this into consideration. This includes, but is not exclusive to: smoking, alcohol, pornography, gambling, and drug use/abuse.",
    "commGuidePara027": "<strong>When a moderator directs you to take a conversation elsewhere, if there is no relevant Guild, they may suggest you use the Back Corner</strong>. The Back Corner Guild is a free public space to discuss potentially sensitive subjects that should only be used when directed there by a moderator. It is carefully monitored by the moderation team. It is not a place for general discussions or conversations, and you will be directed there by a mod only when it is appropriate.",
    "commGuideHeadingPublicGuilds": "公共公會",
    "commGuidePara029": "<strong>Public Guilds are much like the Tavern, except that instead of being centered around general conversation, they have a focused theme</strong>. Public Guild chat should focus on this theme. For example, members of the Wordsmiths Guild might be cross if the conversation is suddenly focusing on gardening instead of writing, and a Dragon-Fanciers Guild might not have any interest in deciphering ancient runes. Some Guilds are more lax about this than others, but in general, <strong>try to stay on topic</strong>!",
    "commGuidePara031": "Some public Guilds will contain sensitive topics such as depression, religion, politics, etc. This is fine as long as the conversations therein do not violate any of the Terms and Conditions or Public Space Rules, and as long as they stay on topic.",
    "commGuidePara033": "<strong>Public Guilds may NOT contain 18+ content. If they plan to regularly discuss sensitive content, they should say so in the Guild description</strong>. This is to keep Habitica safe and comfortable for everyone.",
    "commGuidePara035": "<strong>If the Guild in question has different kinds of sensitive issues, it is respectful to your fellow Habiticans to place your comment behind a warning (ex. \"Warning: references self-harm\")</strong>. These may be characterized as trigger warnings and/or content notes, and Guilds may have their own rules in addition to those given here. If possible, please use <a href='http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet' target='_blank'>markdown</a> to hide the potentially sensitive content below line breaks so that those who may wish to avoid reading it can scroll past it without seeing the content. Habitica staff and moderators may still remove this material at their discretion.",
    "commGuidePara036": "Additionally, the sensitive material should be topical -- bringing up self-harm in a Guild focused on fighting depression may make sense, but is probably less appropriate in a music Guild. If you see someone who is repeatedly violating this guideline, especially after several requests, please flag the posts and notify the moderators via the <a href='http://contact.habitica.com/' target='_blank'>Moderator Contact Form</a>.",
    "commGuidePara037": "<strong>No Guilds, Public or Private, should be created for the purpose of attacking any group or individual</strong>. Creating such a Guild is grounds for an instant ban. Fight bad habits, not your fellow adventurers!",
    "commGuidePara038": "<strong>All Tavern Challenges and Public Guild Challenges must comply with these rules as well</strong>.",

    "commGuidePara051": "<strong>There are a variety of infractions, and they are dealt with depending on their severity</strong>. These are not comprehensive lists, and the Mods can make decisions on topics not covered here at their own discretion. The Mods will take context into account when evaluating infractions.",

    "commGuideList06B": "Backseat Modding. To quickly clarify a relevant point: A friendly mention of the rules is fine. Backseat modding consists of telling, demanding, and/or strongly implying that someone must take an action that you describe to correct a mistake. You can alert someone to the fact that they have committed a transgression, but please do not demand an action -- for example, saying, \"Just so you know, profanity is discouraged in the Tavern, so you may want to delete that,\" would be better than saying, \"I'm going to have to ask you to delete that post.\"",

An example might be \"Please don't keep arguing in favor of this feature idea after we've told you several times that it isn't feasible.\" In many cases, the Please Don't will be the minor consequence as well, but if Mods have to say \"Please Don't\" to the same user enough times, the triggering Minor Infractions will start to count as Moderate Infractions.",
