  "commGuidePara001": "Greetings, adventurer! Welcome to Habitica, the land of productivity, healthy living, and the occasional rampaging gryphon.",
  "commGuidePara002": "To help keep everyone safe, happy, and productive, we do have some guidelines for Challenges, player profiles, Party chat, and private messages. We have carefully crafted these Guidelines to make them as friendly and easy-to-read as possible. Please take the time to read them before you start interacting with fellow players.",

  "commGuidePara015": "Habitica has a few spaces where you may interact with other players. These include private chat contexts (private messages and Party chat) as well as the Looking for Party feature and Challenges.",
  "commGuidePara016": "When navigating the social components of Habitica, there are some general rules to keep everyone safe and happy.",
  
  "commGuideList01A": "Our Guidelines and Terms of Service apply in Challenges, Parties, player profiles, and private messages.",
  "commGuideList02C": "<strong>Do not post images or text that are violent, threatening, or sexually explicit/suggestive, or that promote discrimination, bigotry, racism, sexism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group</strong>. Not even as a joke or meme. This includes slurs as well as statements. Not everyone has the same sense of humor, and so something that you consider a joke may be hurtful to another.",
  "commGuideList02N": "<strong>Report anything you see that breaks these Guidelines or our Terms of Service</strong>. You can report a message directly or notify staff via <a href='mailto:admin@habitica.com' target='_blank'>admin@habitica.com</a> for violations in profiles or Challenges. We will handle them as quickly as possible. You may contact us in your native language if that is easier for you: we may have to use Google Translate, but we want you to feel comfortable about contacting us if you have a problem.",
  "commGuideList02H": "<strong>All Display Names and @usernames must comply with the Terms of Service</strong>. To change your Display Name and/or @username: on mobile go to Menu > Settings > Account. On web, go to Settings from the user icon in the top navigation.",
  "commGuideList02A": "<strong>Respect each other</strong>. Be courteous, kind, friendly, and helpful. Remember: Habiticans come from all backgrounds and have had wildly divergent experiences.",
  "commGuideList02I": "<strong>Challenge names should be appropriate for all spaces, as they will appear in the winner's public profile</strong>. Keep this in mind when creating Challenges as we may be forced to edit the record on their profile if there is a report.",
  "commGuideList02G": "<strong>Comply immediately with any Staff request.</strong> This could include, but is not limited to, requesting you limit your posts in a particular space, editing your profile to remove unsuitable content, etc. Do not argue with Staff. If you have concerns or comments about Staff actions, email <a href='mailto:admin@habitica.com' target='_blank'>admin@habitica.com</a> to contact our community manager.",
  "commGuideList02D": "<strong>Be mindful that Habiticans are of all ages and backgrounds</strong>. Challenges and player profiles should not mention adult topics, use profanity, or promote contention or conflict.",
  "commGuideList02E": "<strong>If a staff member tells you that a term is disallowed on Habitica, even if it is a term that you did not realize was problematic, that decision is final.</strong> Additionally, slurs will be dealt with very severely, as they are also a violation of the Terms of Service.",
  "commGuideList02O": "<strong>Parties may create their own chat rules for membersâ€™ comfort and preferences</strong>. However, the admins cannot enforce chat rules in these private spaces unless there is a breach of the Terms of Service, including harassment. If someone in your Party is causing issues, we encourage the Party leader to remove them.",
  "commGuidePara037": "<strong>No Parties or Groups should be created for the purpose of attacking any group or individual</strong>. Fight bad habits, not your fellow adventurers!",

  "commGuideList02Q": "<strong>Do not try to get around a block</strong>. If someone has blocked you from sending them private messages, do not contact them elsewhere to ask them to unblock you.",
  "commGuideList02M": "<strong>Do not ask or beg for Gems, subscriptions, or membership in Group Plans</strong>. If you see or receive unwanted messages asking for paid items, please report them. Repeated Gem or subscription begging, especially after a warning, may result in an account ban.",
  "commGuideList02L": "<strong>We highly discourage the exchange of personal information--particularly information that can be used to identify you</strong>. Identifying information can include but is not limited to: your address, your email, and your password or API token. If you are asked for personal information in a Party chat or private message, we highly recommend that you do not respond, and alert the Staff by either reporting the message or contacting <a href='mailto:admin@habitica.com' target='_blank'>admin@habitica.com</a> with screenshots of the messages if more context is needed.",
  "commGuideList02J": "<strong>Do not spam</strong>. Spamming may include, but is not limited to: sending multiple unsolicited private messages, sending nonsensical messages, sending multiple promotional messages about a Party or Challenge, or creating multiple similar or low quality Challenges in a row. Staff has discretion to determine what messages are considered spamming.",
  "commGuideList02K": "<strong>Do not send links without explanation or context</strong>. If players clicking on a link will result in any benefit to you, you need to disclose that. This applies in messages as well as Challenges.",
