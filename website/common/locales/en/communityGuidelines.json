  "commGuideHeadingWelcome": "Welcome to Habitica!",
  "commGuidePara001": "Greetings, adventurer! Welcome to Habitica, the land of productivity, healthy living, and the occasional rampaging gryphon. We have a cheerful community full of helpful people supporting each other on their way to self-improvement. To fit in, all it takes is a positive attitude, a respectful manner, and the understanding that everyone has different skills and limitations -- including you! Habiticans are patient with one another and try to help whenever they can.",
  "commGuidePara002": "To help keep everyone safe, happy, and productive in the community, we do have some guidelines. We have carefully crafted them to make them as friendly and easy-to-read as possible. Please take the time to read them before you start chatting.",
  "commGuidePara003": "These rules apply to all of the social spaces we use, including (but not necessarily limited to) Trello, GitHub, Weblate, and the Habitica Wiki on Fandom. As communities grow and change, their rules may adapt from time to time. When there are substantive changes to the community rules listed here, you'll hear about it in a Bailey announcement and/or our social media!",
  "commGuideHeadingInteractions": "Interactions in Habitica",
  "commGuidePara015": "Habitica has two kinds of social spaces: public, and private. Public spaces include the Tavern, Public Guilds, GitHub, Trello, and the Wiki. Private spaces are Private Guilds, Party chat, and Private Messages. All Display Names and @usernames must comply with the public space guidelines. To change your Display Name and/or @username, on mobile go to Menu > Settings > Profile. On web, go to User > Settings.",
  "commGuidePara016": "When navigating the public spaces in Habitica, there are some general rules to keep everyone safe and happy.",

  "commGuidePara017": "Here's the quick version, but we encourage you to read in more detail below:",
  "commGuideList01F": "Please flag posts that break our Community Guidelines or TOS.",
  "commGuideList01A": "Terms & Conditions apply across all spaces, including private guilds, party chat, and messages.",
  "commGuideList01B": "Prohibited: Any communication that is violent, threatening, promoting of discrimination etc. including memes, images, and jokes.",
  "commGuideList01C": "All discussions must be appropriate for all ages and be free of profanity.",
  "commGuideList01D": "Please comply with staff requests.",
  "commGuideList01E": "<strong>Do not instigate or engage in contentious conversation in the Tavern.</strong>",
  "commGuideList01F": "No begging for paid items, spamming, or large header text/all caps.",

  "commGuideList02N": "<strong>Flag and report posts that break these Guidelines or the Terms of Service.</strong> We will handle them as quickly as possible. You may also notify staff via <a href='mailto:admin@habitica.com' target='_blank'>admin@habitica.com</a> but flags are the fastest way to get help.",
  "commGuideList02A": "<strong>Respect each other</strong>. Be courteous, kind, friendly, and helpful. Remember: Habiticans come from all backgrounds and have had wildly divergent experiences. This is part of what makes Habitica so cool! Building a community means respecting and celebrating our differences as well as our similarities.",
  "commGuideList02B": "<strong>Obey all of the <a href='https://habitica.com/static/terms' target='_blank'>Terms and Conditions</a></strong> in both public and private spaces.",
  "commGuideList02G": "<strong>Comply immediately with any Staff request.</strong> This could include, but is not limited to, requesting you limit your posts in a particular space, editing your profile to remove unsuitable content, asking you to move your discussion to a more suitable space, etc. Do not argue with staff. If you have concerns or comments about staff actions, email <a href='mailto:admin@habitica.com' target='_blank'>admin@habitica.com</a> to contact our community manager.",
  "commGuideList02C": "<strong>Do not post images or text that are violent, threatening, or sexually explicit/suggestive, or that promote discrimination, bigotry, racism, sexism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group</strong>. Not even as a joke or meme. This includes slurs as well as statements. Not everyone has the same sense of humor, and so something that you consider a joke may be hurtful to another.",
  "commGuideList02D": "<strong>Keep discussions appropriate for all ages</strong>. This means avoiding adult topics in public spaces. We have many young Habiticans who use the site, and people come from all walks of life. We want our community to be as comfortable and inclusive as possible.",
  "commGuideList02E": "<strong>Avoid profanity. This includes abbreviated or obscured profanity.</strong> We have people from all religious and cultural backgrounds, and we want to make sure that all of them feel comfortable in public spaces. <strong>If a staff member tells you that a term is disallowed on Habitica, even if it is a term that you did not realize was problematic, that decision is final.</strong> Additionally, slurs will be dealt with very severely, as they are also a violation of the Terms of Service.",
  "commGuideList02F": "Avoid extended discussions of divisive topics in the Tavern and where it would be off-topic. If someone mentions something that is allowed by the guidelines but which is hurtful to you, it's okay to politely let them know that. If someone tells you you've made them uncomfortable, take time to reflect instead of responding in anger. But if you feel that a conversation is getting heated, overly emotional, or hurtful, <strong>cease to engage. Instead, report the posts to let us know about it. </strong>Staff will respond as quickly as possible. You may also email <a href='mailto:admin@habitica.com' target='_blank'>admin@habitica.com</a> and include screenshots if they may be helpful.",
  "commGuideList02M": "Do not ask or beg for gems, subscriptions or membership in Group Plans. This is not allowed in the Tavern, public or private chat spaces, or in PMs. If you receive messages asking for paid items, please report them by flagging. Repeated or severe gem or subscription begging, especially after a warning, may result in an account ban.",
  "commGuideList02J": "<strong>Do not spam</strong>. Spamming may include, but is not limited to: posting the same comment or query in multiple places, <strong>posting links without explanation or context</strong>, posting nonsensical messages, posting multiple promotional messages about a Guild, Party or Challenge, or posting many messages in a row. If people clicking on a link will result in any benefit to you, you need to disclose that in the text of your message or that will also be considered spam. Staff may decide what constitutes spam at their discretion.",
  "commGuideList02K": "<strong>Avoid posting large header text in the public chat spaces, particularly the Tavern</strong>. Much like ALL CAPS, it reads as if you were yelling, and interferes with the comfortable atmosphere.",
  "commGuideList02L": "<strong>We highly discourage the exchange of personal information -- particularly information that can be used to identify you -- in public chat spaces</strong>. Identifying information can include but is not limited to: your address, your email address, and your API token/password. This is for your safety! Staff may remove such posts at their discretion. If you are asked for personal information in a private Guild, Party, or PM, we highly recommend that you politely refuse and alert the staff by either 1) flagging the message, or 2) emailing <a href='mailto:admin@habitica.com' target='_blank'>admin@habitica.com</a> and including screenshots.",
  "commGuidePara019": "<strong>In private spaces</strong>, users have more freedom to discuss whatever topics they would like, but they still may not violate the Terms and Conditions, including posting slurs or any discriminatory, violent, or threatening content. Note that, because Challenge names appear in the winner's public profile, ALL Challenge names must obey the public space guidelines, even if they appear in a private space.",
  "commGuidePara020": "<strong>Private Messages (PMs)</strong> have some additional guidelines. If someone has blocked you, do not contact them elsewhere to ask them to unblock you. Additionally, you should not send PMs to someone asking for support (since public answers to support questions are helpful to the community). Finally, do not send anyone PMs begging for paid content of any kind.",
  "commGuidePara020A": "<strong>If you see a post or private message that you believe is in violation of the public space guidelines outlined above, or if you see a post or private message that concerns you or makes you uncomfortable, you can bring it to the attention of Staff by clicking the flag icon to report it</strong>. A Staff member will respond to the situation as soon as possible. Please note that intentionally reporting innocent posts is an infraction of these Guidelines (see below in \"Infractions\"). You can also contact the Staff by emailing <a href='mailto:admin@habitica.com' target='_blank'>admin@habitica.com</a> You may want to do this if there are multiple problematic posts by the same person in different Guilds, or if the situation requires some explanation. You may contact us in your native language if that is easier for you: we may have to use Google Translate, but we want you to feel comfortable about contacting us if you have a problem.",
  "commGuidePara021": "Furthermore, some public spaces in Habitica have additional guidelines.",

  "commGuideHeadingTavern": "The Tavern",
  "commGuidePara022": "The Tavern is the main spot for Habiticans to mingle. Daniel the Innkeeper keeps the place spic-and-span, and Lemoness will happily conjure up some lemonade while you sit and chat. Just keep in mind…",
  "commGuidePara023": "<strong>Conversation tends to revolve around casual chatting and productivity or life improvement tips</strong>. Because the Tavern chat can only hold 200 messages, <strong>it isn't a good place for prolonged conversations on topics, especially sensitive or contentious ones</strong> (ex. politics, religion, depression, whether or not goblin-hunting should be banned, etc.). These conversations should be taken to an applicable Guild. Staff may direct you to a suitable Guild, but it is ultimately your responsibility to find and post in the appropriate place.",
  "commGuidePara024": "<strong>Don't discuss anything addictive in the Tavern</strong>. Many people use Habitica to try to quit their bad Habits. Hearing people talk about addictive/illegal substances may make this much harder for them! Respect your fellow Tavern-goers and take this into consideration. This includes, but is not exclusive to: smoking, alcohol, pornography, gambling, and drug use/abuse.",

  "commGuideHeadingPublicGuilds": "Public Guilds",
  "commGuidePara029": "<strong>Public Guilds are much like the Tavern, except that instead of being centered around general conversation, they have a focused theme</strong>. Public Guild chat should focus on this theme. For example, members of the Wordsmiths Guild might be cross if the conversation is suddenly focusing on gardening instead of writing, and a Dragon-Fanciers Guild might not have any interest in deciphering ancient runes. Some Guilds are more lax about this than others, but in general, <strong>try to stay on topic</strong>!",
  "commGuidePara031": "Some public Guilds will contain sensitive topics such as depression, religion, politics, etc. This is fine as long as the conversations therein do not violate any of the Terms and Conditions or Public Space Rules, and as long as they stay on topic.",
  "commGuidePara033": "<strong>Public Guilds may NOT contain 18+ content. If they plan to regularly discuss sensitive content, they should say so in the Guild description</strong>. This is to keep Habitica safe and comfortable for everyone.",
  "commGuidePara035": "<strong>If the Guild in question has different kinds of sensitive issues, it is respectful to your fellow Habiticans to include a warning (ex. \"Warning: references self-harm\")</strong>. These may be characterized as trigger warnings and/or content notes, and Guilds may have their own rules in addition to those given here. Habitica staff may still remove this material at their discretion.",
  "commGuidePara036": "Additionally, the sensitive material should be topical -- bringing up self-harm in a Guild focused on fighting depression may make sense, but is probably less appropriate in a music Guild. If you see someone who is repeatedly violating this guideline, especially after several requests, please report the posts.",
  "commGuidePara037": "<strong>No Guilds, Public or Private, should be created for the purpose of attacking any group or individual</strong>. Creating such a Guild is grounds for an instant ban. Fight bad habits, not your fellow adventurers!",
  "commGuidePara038": "<strong>All Tavern Challenges and Public Guild Challenges must comply with these rules as well</strong>.",

  "commGuidePara050": "Overwhelmingly, Habiticans assist each other, are respectful, and work to make the whole community fun and friendly. However, once in a blue moon, something that a Habitican does may violate one of the above guidelines. When this happens, the Staff will take whatever actions they deem necessary to keep Habitica safe and comfortable for everyone.",
  "commGuidePara051": "<strong>There are a variety of infractions, and they are dealt with depending on their severity</strong>. These are not comprehensive lists, and the Staff can make decisions on topics not covered here at their own discretion. The Staff will take context into account when evaluating infractions.",

  "commGuideHeadingSevereInfractions": "Severe Infractions",
  "commGuidePara052": "Severe infractions greatly harm the safety of Habitica's community and users, and therefore have severe consequences as a result.",

  "commGuidePara054": "Moderate infractions do not make our community unsafe, but they do make it unpleasant. These infractions will have moderate consequences. When in conjunction with multiple infractions, the consequences may grow more severe.",
  "commGuidePara055": "The following are some examples of Moderate Infractions. This is not a comprehensive list.",
  "commGuideList06A": "<strong>Ignoring, disrespecting or arguing with Staff.</strong> This includes publicly complaining about staff or other users, publicly glorifying or defending banned users, or debating whether or not a staff action was appropriate. If you are concerned about one of the rules or the behavior of the Staff, please contact us via email (<a href='mailto:admin@habitica.com' target='_blank'>admin@habitica.com</a>).",
  "commGuideList06B": "Backseat Modding. To quickly clarify a relevant point: A friendly mention of the rules is fine. Backseat modding consists of telling, demanding, and/or strongly implying that someone must take an action that you describe to correct a mistake. You can alert someone to the fact that they have committed a transgression, but please do not demand an action -- for example, saying, \"Just so you know, profanity is discouraged in the Tavern, so you may want to delete that,\" would be better than saying, \"I'm going to have to ask you to delete that post.\"",

  "commGuideList07B": "Any statements or actions that trigger a \"Please Don't\" from a Staff member. When you are asked not to do something publicly, this in itself can be a consequence. If Staff have to issue many of these corrections to the same person, it may count as a larger infraction",
