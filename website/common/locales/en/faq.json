  "faqQuestion1": "How do I set up my tasks?",
  "iosFaqAnswer1": "Good Habits (the ones with a +) are tasks that you can do many times a day, such as eating vegetables. Bad Habits (the ones with a -) are tasks that you should avoid, like biting nails. Habits with a + and a - have a good choice and a bad choice, like taking the stairs vs. taking the elevator. Good Habits award experience and gold. Bad Habits subtract health.\n\n Dailies are tasks that you have to do every day, like brushing your teeth or checking your email. You can adjust the days that a Daily is due by tapping to edit it. If you skip a Daily that is due, your avatar will take damage overnight.

  "faqQuestion3": "Why do my tasks change color?",
  "iosFaqAnswer3": "Your tasks change color based on how well you are currently accomplishing them! Each new task starts out as a neutral yellow. Perform Dailies or positive Habits more frequently and they move toward blue. Miss a Daily or give in to a bad Habit and the task moves toward red. The redder a task, the more rewards it will give you, but if it's a Daily or bad Habit, the more it will hurt you! This helps motivate you to complete the tasks that are giving you trouble.",

  "faqQuestion4": "Why did my avatar lose health, and how do I regain it?",
  "iosFaqAnswer4": "There are several things that can cause you to take damage. First, if you left Dailies incomplete overnight and didn't check them off in the screen that popped up the next morning, those unfinished Dailies will damage you. Second, if you tap a bad Habit, it will damage you. Finally, if you are in a Boss Battle with your Party and one of your Party mates did not complete all their Dailies, the Boss will attack you.\n\n The main way to heal is to gain a level, which restores all your health. You can also buy a Health Potion with gold from the Rewards column. Plus, at level 10 or above, you can choose to become a Healer, and then you will learn healing skills. If you are in a Party with a Healer, they can heal you as well.",

  "iosFaqAnswer7": "At level 10, you can choose to become a Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Healer. (All players start as Warriors by default.) Each Class has different equipment options, different Skills that they can cast after level 11, and different advantages. Warriors can easily damage Bosses, withstand more damage from their tasks, and help make their Party tougher. Mages can also easily damage Bosses, as well as level up quickly and restore Mana for their party. Rogues earn the most gold and find the most item drops, and they can help their Party do the same. Finally, Healers can heal themselves and their Party members.\n\n If you don't want to choose a Class immediately -- for example, if you are still working to buy all the gear of your current class -- you can click “Decide Later” and choose later under Menu > Choose Class.",

  "faqQuestion8": "What is the blue Stat bar that appears in the Header after level 10?",
  "iosFaqAnswer8": "The blue bar that appeared when you hit level 10 and chose a Class is your Mana bar. As you continue to level up, you will unlock special Skills that cost Mana to use. Each Class has different Skills, which appear after level 11 under Menu > Use Skills. Unlike your health bar, your Mana bar does not reset when you gain a level. Instead, Mana is gained when you complete Good Habits, Dailies, and To-Dos, and lost when you indulge bad Habits. You'll also regain some Mana overnight -- the more Dailies you completed, the more you will gain.",

  "faqQuestion9": "How do I fight monsters and go on Quests?",
  "iosFaqAnswer9": "First, you need to join or start a Party (see above). Although you can battle monsters alone, we recommend playing in a group, because this will make Quests much easier. Plus, having a friend to cheer you on as you accomplish your tasks is very motivating!\n\n Next, you need a Quest Scroll, which are stored under Menu > Items. There are three ways to get a scroll:\n\n - At level 15, you get a Quest-line, aka three linked quests. More Quest-lines unlock at levels 30, 40, and 60 respectively. \n - When you invite people to your Party, you'll be rewarded with the Basi-List Scroll!\n - You can buy Quests from the Quests Shop for Gold and Gems.\n\n To battle the Boss or collect items for a Collection Quest, simply complete your tasks normally, and they will be tallied into damage overnight. (Reloading by pulling down on the screen may be required to see the Boss's health bar go down.) If you are fighting a Boss and you missed any Dailies, the Boss will damage your Party at the same time that you damage the Boss. \n\n After level 11 Mages and Warriors will gain Skills that allow them to deal additional damage to the Boss, so these are excellent classes to choose at level 10 if you want to be a heavy hitter.",
