  "faqQuestion1": "How do I set up my tasks?",
  "iosFaqAnswer1": "Good Habits (the ones with a +) are tasks that you can do many times a day, such as eating vegetables. Bad Habits (the ones with a -) are tasks that you should avoid, like biting nails. Habits with a + and a - have a good choice and a bad choice, like taking the stairs vs. taking the elevator. Good Habits award experience and gold. Bad Habits subtract health.\n\n Dailies are tasks that you have to do every day, like brushing your teeth or checking your email. You can adjust the days that a Daily is due by tapping to edit it. If you skip a Daily that is due, your avatar will take damage overnight. Be careful not to add too many Dailies at once!\n\n To Do's are your To Do list. Completing a To Do earns you gold and experience. You never lose health from To Do's.

  "faqQuestion3": "Why do my tasks change color?",
  "iosFaqAnswer3": "Your tasks change color based on how well you are currently accomplishing them! Each new task starts out as a neutral yellow. Perform Dailies or positive Habits more frequently and they move toward blue. Miss a Daily or give in to a bad Habit and the task moves toward red.

  "faqQuestion4": "Why did my avatar lose health, and how do I regain it?",
  "iosFaqAnswer4": "There are several things that can cause you to take damage. First, if you left Dailies incomplete overnight and didn't check them off in the screen that popped up the next morning, those unfinished Dailies will damage you. Second, if you tap a bad Habit, it will damage you. Finally, if you are in a Boss Battle with your Party and one of your Party mates did not complete all their Dailies, the Boss will attack you.\n\n The main way to heal is to gain a level, which restores all your health. You can also buy a Health Potion with gold from the Rewards column. Plus, at level 10 or above, you can choose to become a Healer, and then you will learn healing skills.

  "iosFaqAnswer7": "At level 10, you can choose to become a Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Healer. (All players start as Warriors by default.)

Warriors can easily damage Bosses, withstand more damage from their tasks, and help make their Party tougher. Mages can also easily damage Bosses, as well as level up quickly and restore Mana for their party. Rogues earn the most gold and find the most item drops, and they can help their Party do the same. Finally, Healers can heal themselves and their Party members.\n\n If you don't want to choose a Class immediately -- for example, if you are still working to buy all the gear of your current class -- you can tap “Cancel” and choose later by opening the Menu, tapping the Settings icon, then tapping “Enable Class System”.",

  "iosFaqAnswer8": "The blue bar that appeared when you hit level 10 and chose a Class is your Mana bar. As you continue to level up, you will unlock special Skills that cost Mana to use. Each Class has different Skills, which appear after level 11 under Menu > Use Skills. Unlike your health bar, your Mana bar does not reset when you gain a level.

  "faqQuestion13": "What is a Group Plan?",
  "iosFaqAnswer13": "## How do Group Plans work?\n\nA [Group Plan](/group-plans) gives your existing Party or new Group access to a shared task board that’s similar to your personal task board! It’s a shared Habitica experience where tasks can be created and checked off by anyone in the group.\n\nThere are also features available like member roles, status view, and task assigning that give you a more controlled experience. [Visit our wiki](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Group_Plans) to learn more about our Group Plans’ features!\n\n## Who benefits from a Group Plan?\n\nGroup Plans work best when you have a small team of people who want to collaborate together. We recommend 2-5 members.\n\nGroup Plans are great for families, whether it’s a parent and child or you and a partner. Shared goals, chores, or responsibilities are easy to keep track of on one board.\n\nGroup Plans can also be useful for teams of colleagues that have shared goals, or managers that want to introduce their employees to gamification.\n\n## Quick tips for using Groups\n\nHere are some quick tips to get you started with your new Group. We’ll provide more details in the following sections:\n\n* Make a member a manager to give them the ability to create and edit tasks\n* Leave tasks unassigned if anyone can complete it and it only needs done once\n* Assign a task to one person to make sure no one else can complete their task\n* Assign a task to multiple people if they all need to complete it\n* Toggle the ability to display shared tasks on your personal board to not miss anything\n* You get rewarded for the tasks you complete, even multi-assigned\n* Task completion rewards aren’t shared or split between Team members\n* Use task color on the team board to judge the average completion rate of tasks\n* Regularly review the tasks on your Team Board to make sure they are still relevant\n* Missing a Daily won’t damage you or your team, but the task will degrade in color\n\n## How can others in the group create tasks?\n\nOnly the group leader and managers can create tasks. If you’d like a group member to be able to create tasks, then you should promote them to be a manager by going to the Group Information tab, viewing the member list, and clicking the dot icon by their name.\n\n## How does assigning a task work?\n\nGroup Plans give you the unique ability to assign tasks to other group members. Assigning a task is great for delegating. If you assign a task to someone, then other members are prevented from completing it.\n\nYou can also assign a task to multiple people if it needs to be completed by more than one member. For example, if everyone has to brush their teeth, create a task and assign it to each group member. They will all be able to check it off and get their individual rewards for doing so. The main task will show as complete once everyone checks it off.\n\n## How do unassigned tasks work?\n\nUnassigned tasks can be completed by anyone in the group, so leave a task unassigned to allow any member to complete it. For example, taking out the trash. Whoever takes out the trash can check off the unassigned task and it will show as completed for everyone.\n\n## How does the synchronized day reset work?\n\nShared tasks will reset at the same time for everyone to keep the shared task board in sync. This time is visible on the shared task board and is determined by the group leader’s day start time. Because shared tasks reset automatically, you will not get a chance to complete yesterday’s uncompleted shared Dailies when you check in the next morning.\n\nShared Dailies will not do damage if they are missed, however they will degrade in color to help visualize progress. We don’t want the shared experience to be a negative one!\n\n## How do I use my Group on the mobile apps?\n\nWhile the mobile apps don’t fully support all Group Plans functionality yet, you can still complete shared tasks from the iOS and Android app by copying the tasks onto your personal task board. You can switch this preference on from Settings in the mobile apps or from the group task board on the browser version. Now open and assigned shared tasks will display on your personal task board across all platforms.\n\n## What’s the difference between a Group’s shared tasks and Challenges?\n\nGroup Plan shared task boards are more dynamic than Challenges, in that they can constantly be updated and interacted with.

  "androidFaqAnswer13": "## How do Group Plans work?\n\nA [Group Plan](/group-plans) gives your existing Party or new Group access to a shared task board that’s similar to your personal task board! It’s a shared Habitica experience where tasks can be created and checked off by anyone in the group.\n\nThere are also features available like member roles, status view, and task assigning that give you a more controlled experience. [Visit our wiki](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Group_Plans) to learn more about our Group Plans’ features!\n\n## Who benefits from a Group Plan?\n\nGroup Plans work best when you have a small team of people who want to collaborate together. We recommend 2-5 members.\n\nGroup Plans are great for families, whether it’s a parent and child or you and a partner. Shared goals, chores, or responsibilities are easy to keep track of on one board.\n\nGroup Plans can also be useful for teams of colleagues that have shared goals, or managers that want to introduce their employees to gamification.\n\n## Quick tips for using Groups\n\nHere are some quick tips to get you started with your new Group. We’ll provide more details in the following sections:\n\n* Make a member a manager to give them the ability to create and edit tasks\n* Leave tasks unassigned if anyone can complete it and it only needs done once\n* Assign a task to one person to make sure no one else can complete their task\n* Assign a task to multiple people if they all need to complete it\n* Toggle the ability to display shared tasks on your personal board to not miss anything\n* You get rewarded for the tasks you complete, even multi-assigned\n* Task completion rewards aren’t shared or split between Team members\n* Use task color on the team board to judge the average completion rate of tasks\n* Regularly review the tasks on your Team Board to make sure they are still relevant\n* Missing a Daily won’t damage you or your team, but the task will degrade in color\n\n## How can others in the group create tasks?\n\nOnly the group leader and managers can create tasks. If you’d like a group member to be able to create tasks, then you should promote them to be a manager by going to the Group Information tab, viewing the member list, and clicking the dot icon by their name.\n\n## How does assigning a task work?\n\nGroup Plans give you the unique ability to assign tasks to other group members. Assigning a task is great for delegating. If you assign a task to someone, then other members are prevented from completing it.\n\nYou can also assign a task to multiple people if it needs to be completed by more than one member. For example, if everyone has to brush their teeth, create a task and assign it to each group member. They will all be able to check it off and get their individual rewards for doing so. The main task will show as complete once everyone checks it off.\n\n## How do unassigned tasks work?\n\nUnassigned tasks can be completed by anyone in the group, so leave a task unassigned to allow any member to complete it. For example, taking out the trash. Whoever takes out the trash can check off the unassigned task and it will show as completed for everyone.\n\n## How does the synchronized day reset work?\n\nShared tasks will reset at the same time for everyone to keep the shared task board in sync. This time is visible on the shared task board and is determined by the group leader’s day start time. Because shared tasks reset automatically, you will not get a chance to complete yesterday’s uncompleted shared Dailies when you check in the next morning.\n\nShared Dailies will not do damage if they are missed, however they will degrade in color to help visualize progress. We don’t want the shared experience to be a negative one!\n\n## How do I use my Group on the mobile apps?\n\nWhile the mobile apps don’t fully support all Group Plans functionality yet, you can still complete shared tasks from the iOS and Android app by copying the tasks onto your personal task board. You can switch this preference on from Settings in the mobile apps or from the group task board on the browser version. Now open and assigned shared tasks will display on your personal task board across all platforms.\n\n## What’s the difference between a Group’s shared tasks and Challenges?\n\nGroup Plan shared task boards are more dynamic than Challenges, in that they can constantly be updated and interacted with. Challenges are great if you have one set of tasks to send out to many people.\n\nGroup Plans are also a paid feature, while Challenges are available free to everyone.\n\nYou cannot assign specific tasks in Challenges, and Challenges do not have a shared day reset.

  "sunsetFaqPara1": "Due to a number of factors, including changes in how our player base interacts with Habitica and new content regulations, we are making the difficult decision to discontinue Tavern and Guild services on <strong>August 8, 2023</strong>.",
  "sunsetFaqPara2": "Habitica’s primary purpose is and has always been to provide a gamified task management experience. Tavern and Guilds helped motivate players by helping them find others with similar goals. Some truly wonderful spaces were created and we had a chance to see the community thrive with helpful discussion. As the years passed, we noticed changes in how players use and rely on Habitica. Parties flourished, while Guilds and public spaces were used by less and less of our player base. In an ever changing internet landscape, the resources necessary to maintain these spaces became too disproportionate to the number of people actually participating in them.",
  "sunsetFaqPara3": "We’re making this decision so we can better focus our resources on the parts of Habitica players rely on most without disrupting anyone’s access.",
  "sunsetFaqPara4": "To celebrate the times we’ve had, we will be gifting everyone a Veteran Pet as we move forward into this new era. For our amazing contributors, we’ll also be sending out a special gear set to commemorate all their hard work in Habitica’s communities.",

  "sunsetFaqHeader2": "Why are the Tavern and Guild services ending?",
  "sunsetFaqList1": "Habitica’s primary purpose is to provide motivation through a gamified task management experience. Guilds and Tavern are utilized by a disproportionately small percentage of our player base. The majority of players use outside services that are primarily intended for social interaction and are intentionally designed and maintained with those use cases in mind.",
  "sunsetFaqList2": "New online safety laws require a level of active content oversight for public spaces that Habitica has historically not provided. Investing in the features that these new regulations would require would result in our limited resources being redirected towards parts of Habitica that the vast majority of players never touch.",
  "sunsetFaqList3": "It’s important to us to continue offering worldwide access to Habitica’s ever-growing international player base. Removing these services allows us to continue that goal without having to consider restricting access in regions where more active content oversight than we can provide is required.",

  "sunsetFaqHeader3": "Will I still be able to talk with my Party or Group Plan members?",
  "sunsetFaqPara7": "Parties and Group Plans will remain and retain their chat spaces. You’ll also still be able to send private messages.",

  "sunsetFaqHeader4": "Where do I go to pause my Dailies?",
  "sunsetFaqPara8": "This feature has been relocated to Settings. The functions of Pause Damage will not be affected by the end of the Tavern and Guild services.",

  "sunsetFaqHeader5": "How will I access my Group Plan if it’s an upgraded Guild?",
  "sunsetFaqPara9": "<p><strong>Browser</strong>: Click on the Group Plan navigation in the top bar.</p><p><strong>Android:</strong> Tap your name at the top of the screen when viewing a task list to switch to your shared tasks. To access your chat, tap the chat icon in the header on that screen.</p><p><strong>iOS</strong>: Tap the name of your Group Plan in the menu.</p>",

The team is working hard to add more platform support and improvements to this feature in the near future. You can learn more about how to search for Parties and Party members from our FAQ.",

  "sunsetFaqHeader8": "How does this affect Habitica contributors?",
  "sunsetFaqPara12": "As an open-source project, we welcome and encourage many types of contributions. To show our appreciation we will be sending the Heroic gear set to everyone that has a contributor tier as of <strong>August 1, 2023</strong>. When Tavern and Guild services end, there will be some changes to contributions as well. You can read more about the plan for each type below.",
  "sunsetFaqPara13": "<strong>Blacksmiths</strong><br />We still welcome open-source help through our GitHub and will continue awarding tiers for qualifying contributions. Blacksmith collaboration and discussion has largely taken place over GitHub and that will continue.",
  "sunsetFaqPara14": "<strong>Linguists</strong><br />We continue to welcome help with translating the apps and website and will still be awarding contributor tiers for qualifying contributions. However, the method with which we accept translations will be changing. We’d like to focus our resources on supporting a set selection of languages across all platforms. To do this, we will be reducing the amount of languages available for translation. Previously unfinished languages will be archived in Github. We hope this change will make the cross platform Habitica experience more consistent. You can read our most up to date translation procedure guidelines on our <a href='https://translate.habitica.com/projects/habitica/#information'>translation website</a>.",
  "sunsetFaqPara15": "<strong>Challengers</strong><br />The team encourages you to continue creating high quality Challenges. We would like to explore new ways of promoting Challenge discoverability in and outside of the app.",
  "sunsetFaqPara16": "<strong>Socialites</strong><br />This type of contribution will be ending with the Tavern and Guild discontinuation. We are extremely grateful for the work that our friendly and helpful players have done answering questions in our chat spaces.",
  "sunsetFaqPara17": "<strong>Comrades</strong><br />Scripts and add-ons are helpful to a shrinking section of our user base as the mobile apps increasingly become the only way that most users access Habitica. Contributors wishing to create 3rd party tools to customize their Habitica experience can continue doing so, but we will no longer be awarding Comrade tiers as we focus on contributions that enhance Habitica in a way that is accessible to our player base as a whole.",
  "sunsetFaqPara18": "<strong>Artisans</strong><br />We are discontinuing artisan contributions. Most art production has already been moved in-house to keep up with our content releases. We are deeply grateful for the fantastic art made over the years by our contributor community.",
  "sunsetFaqPara19": "<strong>Wiki Wizards</strong><br />The Habitica Wiki is a wonderful tool created by players for players that has helped so many. We continue to support this effort, but will no longer be tracking or offering tiers for Wiki editing as we shift our focus towards Linguist, Blacksmith, and Challenger contributions within Habitica.",

  "sunsetFaqHeader9": "How will Challenges be affected?",
