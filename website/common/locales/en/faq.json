  "faqQuestion25": "What are the different task types?",
  "webFaqAnswer25": "Habitica uses three different task types to accommodate your needs: Habits, Dailies, and To Do’s.\n\nHabits can be positive or negative and represent something you may want to track multiple times per day, or on an unset schedule. Positive Habits will provide you with rewards, like Gold and Experience (Exp), while Negative Habits will cause you to lose health points (HP).\n\nDailies are repeated tasks you want to complete on a more structured schedule. E.g. Once per day, three times a week, or four times a month. Missing Dailies causes you to lose HP, but the more difficult they are, the better the rewards!\n\nTo Do’s are one-off tasks that provide rewards after you complete them. To Do’s can have a due date, but you won’t lose HP if you miss it.\n\nPick the task type that best fits what you want to achieve!",

  "faqQuestion26": "What are some sample tasks?",
  "webFaqAnswer26": "Positive Habits (Behaviors you want to encourage; should have a plus button)\n\n * Take vitamins\n * Floss teeth\n * One hour of studying\n\nNegative Habits (Behaviors you want to limit or avoid; should have a minus button)\n\n * Smoking\n * Doom scrolling\n * Biting nails\n\nDual Habits (Habits that involve a positive vs. negative option; should have both plus and minus buttons)\n\n * Drink water vs. drink soda\n * Study vs. procrastinate\n\nSample Dailies (Tasks you want to repeat on a regular schedule)\n * Wash dishes\n * Water plants\n * 30 minutes of physical activity\n\nSample To Do’s (Tasks you only need to do once)\n\n * Schedule appointment\n * Organize closet\n * Finish essay",

  "faqQuestion27": "Why do tasks change color?",
  "webFaqAnswer27": "The color of a task is a visual representation of the task’s value. All tasks start as yellow for neutral, blue is better, and red is worse. Here’s how each task type determines the task’s value:\n\nHabits become more blue or red based on whether you tap the plus or minus button. Positive and negative Habits degrade to yellow over time if you don’t complete them. Dual Habits only change color based on your inputs.\n\nDailies change color based on how often they are completed, becoming more blue as they’re completed or more red if they’re missed.\n\nTo Do’s gradually get more red the longer they stay incomplete.\n\nThe more red the task, the more Gold and Exp you’ll earn for completing it, so be sure to take on even your toughest tasks!",

  "faqQuestion28": "Can I pause my Dailies if I need a break?",
  "webFaqAnswer28": "Yes! The “Pause Damage” button can be found in Settings. It will prevent you from losing HP for missed Dailies. This is helpful if you are on vacation, need a rest, or for any other reason you might need a break. If you are participating in a Quest, your own pending progress will be paused, but you will still take damage from your Party member’s missed Dailies.\n\nTo pause specific Dailies, you can edit the scheduling to make it due every 0 days until you’re ready to restart it.",

  "faqQuestion29": "How do I recover HP?",
  "webFaqAnswer29": "You can recover 15 HP by purchasing a Health Potion from your Rewards column for 25 Gold. Additionally, you will always recover full HP when you level up!",

  "faqQuestion30": "What happens when I run out of HP?",
  "webFaqAnswer30": "If your HP reaches zero, you’ll lose one level, all of your Gold, and a piece of Equipment that can be repurchased.",

  "faqQuestion31": "Why did I lose HP when interacting with a non-negative task?",
  "webFaqAnswer31": "If you complete a task and lose HP when you shouldn’t have, you encountered a delay while the server is syncing changes made on other platforms. For example, if you use Gold, Mana, or lose HP on the mobile app and then complete a task on the website, the server is simply confirming everything is in sync.",

  "faqQuestion32": "When can I choose a class?",
  "webFaqAnswer32": "There are four classes in Habitica: Warrior, Mage, Rogue, and Healer. All players start as the Warrior class until they reach level 10. Once you reach level 10, you’ll be given the choice between selecting a new class or continuing as a Warrior.\n\nEach class has different Equipment and Skills. If you don't want to choose a class, you can select \"Opt Out.\" If you choose to opt out, you can always enable the Class System from Settings later.",

  "faqQuestion33": "What is the blue bar that appears after level 10?",

  "faqQuestion39": "Where can I get more Equipment?",
  "webFaqAnswer39": "If you’re looking to get more Equipment, you can become a Habitica Subscriber, take a chance on the Enchanted Armoire, or splurge during one of Habitica’s Grand Galas.\n\nHabitica subscribers receive a special exclusive gear set every month and Mystic Hourglasses to buy past Equipment sets from the Time Traveler Shop.\n\nThe Enchanted Armoire treasure chest in your Rewards has over 350 pieces of Equipment!

  "faqQuestion42": "What can I do to increase accountability?",
  "webFaqAnswer42": "One of the best ways to motivate yourself and hold yourself accountable for accomplishing your tasks is to join a Party! Partying with other Habitica players is a great way to take on Quests to receive Pets and Equipment, receive buffs from Party members’ Skills, and boost your motivation.\n\nAnother way to increase accountability is to join a Challenge. Challenges automatically add tasks related to a specific goal to your lists! They also add an element of competition against other Habitica players that may give you a motivation boost as you strive for the Gem prize. There are official Challenges created by the Habitica Team as well Challenges made by other players.",

  "faqQuestion43": "How do I take on Quests?",
  "webFaqAnswer43": "To begin a Quest, you will need to be a member of a Party. Parties can be solo adventures where you challenge Quests alone, or you can invite other Habitica players to tackle Quests at a quicker rate!\n\nChoose a Quest Scroll from your inventory by selecting the “Begin Quest” button from your Party. Complete your tasks as you normally would to progress on the Quest! You’ll either build up damage against a monster if you’re taking on a Boss Quest, or have a chance to find items if you’re taking on a Collection Quest. All pending progress is applied the next day.\n\nWhen you do enough damage or collect all items, the Quest is complete and you will receive your rewards!",

  "faqQuestion44": "How can I delete Challenge tasks?",

  "faqQuestion62": "How do assigned tasks work?",
  "webFaqAnswer62": "Group Plans give you the unique ability to assign shared tasks to other members of your Group Plan. When a shared task is assigned to a member, other members are prevented from completing it.\n\nYou can also assign a task to multiple members. For example, if everyone has to brush their teeth, create a task and assign it to each member. Each member will be able to complete the task and earn their individual rewards. The main task will show as complete once everyone has completed it.",

  "faqQuestion63": "How do unassigned tasks work?",

  "faqQuestion64": "How does the synchronized day reset work?",
  "webFaqAnswer64": "Shared tasks will reset at the same time for everyone to keep the shared task board in sync. This time is visible on the shared task board and is determined by the Group Plan leader’s day start time. Because shared tasks reset automatically, you will not get a chance to complete yesterday’s uncompleted shared Dailies when you check in the next morning.\n\nShared Dailies will not do damage if they are missed, however they will degrade in color to help visualize progress.",

  "faqQuestion65": "Are Group Plans supported on the mobile apps?",
  "webFaqAnswer65": "While the mobile apps don’t fully support all Group Plans functionality yet, you can still complete shared tasks from the iOS and Android apps!\n\nOn Android, you can tap your Display Name at the top of the screen when viewing your tasks to switch to your shared task board. From there you can view members, access your chat, and create, complete, or assign tasks.\n\nYou can also switch on a preference to copy shared tasks to your personal task board so you can complete all your tasks from one place.\n\nTo do this on the mobile apps:\n * Open Settings and switch on “Copy shared tasks”\n\nTo do this on Habitica’s website:\n * Navigate to your Group Plan and switch on the “Copy tasks” toggle on the shared task board",

  "faqQuestion66": "What’s the difference between a Group Plan’s shared tasks and Challenge tasks?",
  "webFaqAnswer66": "Group Plan shared task boards are more dynamic than Challenges, in that they can constantly be updated and interacted with. Challenges are great if you have one set of tasks to send out to many people.\n\nGroup Plans are also a paid feature, while Challenges are available free to everyone.\n\nYou cannot assign specific tasks in Challenges, and Challenges do not have a shared day reset. In general, Challenges offer less control and direct interaction.",

  "sunsetFaqTitle": "Habitica Tavern and Guild Service Discontinuation FAQ",

  "sunsetFaqPara1": "Due to a number of factors, including changes in how our player base interacts with Habitica and new content regulations, we are making the difficult decision to discontinue Tavern and Guild services on <strong>August 8, 2023</strong>.",
  "sunsetFaqPara2": "Habitica’s primary purpose is and has always been to provide a gamified task management experience. Tavern and Guilds helped motivate players by helping them find others with similar goals. Some truly wonderful spaces were created and we had a chance to see the community thrive with helpful discussion. As the years passed, we noticed changes in how players use and rely on Habitica. Parties flourished, while Guilds and public spaces were used by less and less of our player base. In an ever changing internet landscape, the resources necessary to maintain these spaces became too disproportionate to the number of people actually participating in them.",
  "sunsetFaqPara3": "We’re making this decision so we can better focus our resources on the parts of Habitica players rely on most without disrupting anyone’s access.",
  "sunsetFaqPara4": "To celebrate the times we’ve had, we will be gifting everyone a Veteran Pet as we move forward into this new era. For our amazing contributors, we’ll also be sending out a special gear set to commemorate all their hard work in Habitica’s communities.",
  "sunsetFaqPara5": "If you’d like to know more about what's changing, you can read the details below.",

  "sunsetFaqHeader1": "Which services are ending?",
  "sunsetFaqPara6": "Service for Tavern as well as public and private Guilds is ending and these spaces will be removed from Habitica on <strong>August 8, 2023</strong>.",

  "sunsetFaqHeader2": "Why are the Tavern and Guild services ending?",
  "sunsetFaqList1": "Habitica’s primary purpose is to provide motivation through a gamified task management experience. Guilds and Tavern are utilized by a disproportionately small percentage of our player base. The majority of players use outside services that are primarily intended for social interaction and are intentionally designed and maintained with those use cases in mind.",
  "sunsetFaqList2": "New online safety laws require a level of active content oversight for public spaces that Habitica has historically not provided. Investing in the features that these new regulations would require would result in our limited resources being redirected towards parts of Habitica that the vast majority of players never touch.",
  "sunsetFaqList3": "It’s important to us to continue offering worldwide access to Habitica’s ever-growing international player base. Removing these services allows us to continue that goal without having to consider restricting access in regions where more active content oversight than we can provide is required.",

  "sunsetFaqHeader3": "Will I still be able to talk with my Party or Group Plan members?",
  "sunsetFaqPara7": "Parties and Group Plans will remain and retain their chat spaces. You’ll also still be able to send private messages.",

  "sunsetFaqHeader4": "Where do I go to pause my Dailies?",
  "sunsetFaqPara8": "This feature has been relocated to Settings. The functions of Pause Damage will not be affected by the end of the Tavern and Guild services.",

  "sunsetFaqHeader8": "How does this affect Habitica contributors?",
  "sunsetFaqPara12": "As an open-source project, we welcome and encourage many types of contributions. To show our appreciation we will be sending the Heroic gear set to everyone that has a contributor tier as of <strong>August 1, 2023</strong>. When Tavern and Guild services end, there will be some changes to contributions as well. You can read more about the plan for each type below.",
  "sunsetFaqPara13": "<strong>Blacksmiths</strong><br />We still welcome open-source help through our GitHub and will continue awarding tiers for qualifying contributions. Blacksmith collaboration and discussion has largely taken place over GitHub and that will continue.",
  "sunsetFaqPara14": "<strong>Linguists</strong><br />We continue to welcome help with translating the apps and website and will still be awarding contributor tiers for qualifying contributions. However, the method with which we accept translations will be changing. We’d like to focus our resources on supporting a set selection of languages across all platforms. To do this, we will be reducing the amount of languages available for translation. Previously unfinished languages will be archived in Github. We hope this change will make the cross platform Habitica experience more consistent. You can read our most up to date translation procedure guidelines on our <a href='https://translate.habitica.com/projects/habitica/#information'>translation website</a>.",
  "sunsetFaqPara15": "<strong>Challengers</strong><br />The team encourages you to continue creating high quality Challenges. We would like to explore new ways of promoting Challenge discoverability in and outside of the app.",
  "sunsetFaqPara16": "<strong>Socialites</strong><br />This type of contribution will be ending with the Tavern and Guild discontinuation. We are extremely grateful for the work that our friendly and helpful players have done answering questions in our chat spaces.",
  "sunsetFaqPara17": "<strong>Comrades</strong><br />Scripts and add-ons are helpful to a shrinking section of our user base as the mobile apps increasingly become the only way that most users access Habitica. Contributors wishing to create 3rd party tools to customize their Habitica experience can continue doing so, but we will no longer be awarding Comrade tiers as we focus on contributions that enhance Habitica in a way that is accessible to our player base as a whole.",
  "sunsetFaqPara18": "<strong>Artisans</strong><br />We are discontinuing artisan contributions. Most art production has already been moved in-house to keep up with our content releases. We are deeply grateful for the fantastic art made over the years by our contributor community.",
  "sunsetFaqPara19": "<strong>Wiki Wizards</strong><br />The Habitica Wiki is a wonderful tool created by players for players that has helped so many. We continue to support this effort, but will no longer be tracking or offering tiers for Wiki editing as we shift our focus towards Linguist, Blacksmith, and Challenger contributions within Habitica.",

  "sunsetFaqList5": "Challenges based in Parties and Group Plans will remain and be unaffected by the end of Tavern and Guild services.",
  "sunsetFaqList6": "Challenges that are currently hosted in Guilds will remain accessible to current participants from their Challenges list, but will not be discoverable in the public list due to privacy concerns. It will not be possible to create new Guild-based Challenges.",
  "sunsetFaqList7": "Currently many Challenges have tasks that require posts in Habitica’s public chat spaces. Creators of those Challenges can adapt their tasks or move the chat requirement to posting on an outside service.",

  "sunsetFaqHeader10": "Where will players go when they have questions about how to use Habitica?",
  "sunsetFaqList8": "Our existing <a href='https://habitica.com/static/faq'>FAQ</a> is a great resource and can be found from the Help menu, or Support on mobile. We are in the process of creating a more comprehensive and improved FAQ to help guide players moving forward.",    
  "sunsetFaqList9": "This <a href='https://habitica.wordpress.com/beginning-adventurers-guide/'>blog post</a> also provides a handy guide for new players.",
  "sunsetFaqList10": "Players are also encouraged to email <a href='mailto:admin@habitica.com'>admin@habitica.com</a> with any questions for which they cannot find answers in the above links.",

  "sunsetFaqHeader11": "How does this affect Habitica’s Community Guidelines and Terms of Service?",
  "sunsetFaqPara20": "Habitica’s Community Guidelines will be updated at the time Tavern and Guild service is discontinued.
