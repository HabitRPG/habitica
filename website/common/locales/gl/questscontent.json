Will you aid us?”<br><br>When you nod, he waves his hands to open a portal, revealing an underwater room. “Swim down with me to Dilatory, and we will scour my library for any references that might give us a clue.” At your look of confusion, he adds, “Don’t worry, the paper was enchanted long before Dilatory sank. None of the books are the slightest bit damp!” He winks.“Unlike Lady Glaciate’s mammoths.”<br><br>“I heard that, Manta.”<br><br>As you dive into the water after the Master of Mages, your legs magically fuse into fins.

I might have guessed, considering the attacks by reanimated skulls during each incident.” Her assistant @tricksy.fox brings in a chest, and you are startled to see the contents that @beffymaroo unloads: the very same objects once used by this mysterious Tzina to possess people.<br><br>“I’m going to use resonant healing magic to try to make this creature manifest,” the Joyful Reaper says, reminding you that the skeleton is a somewhat unconventional Healer. “You’ll need to read the revealed information quickly, in case it breaks loose.”<br><br>As she concentrates, a twisting mist begins to siphon from the books and twine around the objects. Quickly, you flip through the pages, trying to read the new lines of text that are writhing into view. You catch only a few snippets: “Sands of the Timewastes” — “the Great Disaster” —“split into four”— “permanently corrupted”— before a single name catches your eye: Zinnya.<br><br>Abruptly, the pages wrench free from your fingers and shred themselves as a howling creature explodes into being, coalescing around the possessed objects.<br><br>“It’s an a’Voidant!” the Joyful Reaper shouts, throwing up a protection spell. “They’re ancient creatures of confusion and obscurity. If this Tzina can control one, she must have a frightening command over life magic. Quickly, attack it before it escapes back into the books!”<br><br>",

Portals often fail nearby, but swift mounts could get you there in no time. Lady Glaciate will be glad to assist.” Her voice grows amused. “Which means that the enamored Master of Rogues will undoubtedly tag along.” She hands you the glimmering mask. “Perhaps you should try to track the lingering magic in these items to its source.

Some bleached pillars poke from the shadowed dunes, and as you approach them, a strange skittering sound echoes across the seemingly-abandoned expanse.<br><br>“Invisible creatures!” says the April Fool, clearly covetous. “Oho! Just imagine the possibilities. This must be the work of a truly stealthy Rogue.”<br><br>“A Rogue who could be watching us,” says Lady Glaciate, dismounting and raising her spear. “If there’s a head-on attack, try not to irritate our opponent. I don’t want a repeat of the volcano incident.”<br><br>He beams at her. “But it was one of your most resplendent rescues.”<br><br>To your surprise, Lady Glaciate turns very pink at the compliment. She hastily stomps away to examine the ruins.<br><br>“Looks like the wreck of an ancient city,” says @AnnDeLune. “I wonder what…”<br><br>Before she can finish her sentence, a portal roars open in the sky.

These four are a mockery, each possessing only a fragment of what I once had! I commanded every spell and learned every skill. I shaped your very world to my whim — until the traitorous aether itself collapsed under the weight of my talents and my perfectly reasonable expectations. I have been trapped for millennia in this resulting void, recuperating. Imagine my disgust when I learned how my legacy had been corrupted.” She lets out a low, echoing laugh. “My plan was to destroy their domains before destroying them, but I suppose the order is irrelevant.” With a burst of uncanny strength, she charges forward, and the Realm of Void explodes into chaos.",

The thrashing void stills around her as she slumps forward, and for a moment, she seems to change, becoming younger, calmer, with an expression of peace upon her face… but then everything melts away with scarcely a whisper, and you’re kneeling once more in the desert sand.<br><br>“It seems that we have much to learn about our own history,” King Manta says, staring at the broken ruins. “After the Master Aethermancer grew overwhelmed and lost control of her abilities, the outpouring of void must have leached the life from the entire land. Everything probably became deserts like this.”<br><br>“No wonder the ancients who founded Habitica stressed a balance of productivity and wellness,” the Joyful Reaper murmurs. “Rebuilding their world would have been a daunting task requiring considerable hard work, but they would have wanted to prevent such a catastrophe from happening again.”<br><br>“Oho, look at those formerly possessed items!” says the April Fool. Sure enough, all of them shimmer with a pale, glimmering translucence from the final burst of aether released when you laid Anti’zinnya’s spirit to rest. “What a dazzling effect. I must take notes.”<br><br>“The concentrated remnants of aether in this area probably caused these animals to go invisible, too,” says Lady Glaciate, scratching a patch of emptiness behind the ears. You feel an unseen fluffy head nudge your hand, and suspect that you’ll have to do some explaining at the Stables back home. As you look at the ruins one last time, you spot all that remains of the first Masterclasser: her shimmering cloak.

    "questSeaSerpentNotes": "Your streaks have you feeling lucky—it’s the perfect time for a trip to the seahorse racetrack. You board the submarine at Diligent Docks and settle in for the trip to Dilatory, but you’ve barely submerged when an impact rocks the sub, sending its occupants tumbling. “What’s going on?” @AriesFaries shouts.<br><br>You glance through a nearby porthole and are shocked by the wall of shimmering scales passing by it. “Sea serpent!” Captain @Witticaster calls through the intercom. “Brace yourselves, it’s coming ‘round again!” As you grip the arms of your seat, your unfinished tasks flash before your eyes. ‘Maybe if we work together and complete them,’ you think, ‘we can drive this monster away!’",
    "questSeaSerpentCompletion": "Battered by your commitment, the sea serpent flees, disappearing into the depths. When you arrive in Dilatory, you breathe a sigh of relief before noticing @*~Seraphina~ approaching with three translucent eggs cradled in her arms. “Here, you should have these,” she says. “You know how to handle a sea serpent!” As you accept the eggs, you vow anew to remain steadfast in completing your tasks to ensure that there’s not a repeat occurrence.",

    "questKangarooNotes": "Maybe you should have finished that last task… you know, the one you keep avoiding, even though it always comes back around? But @Mewrose and @LilithofAlfheim invited you and @stefalupagus to see a rare kangaroo troop hopping through the Sloensteadi Savannah; how could you say no?! As the troop comes into view, something hits you on the back of the head with a mighty <em>whack!</em><br><br>Shaking the stars from your vision, you pick up the responsible object--a dark red boomerang, with the very task you continually push back etched into its surface. A quick glance around confirms the rest of your party met a similar fate. One larger kangaroo looks at you with a smug grin, like she’s daring you to face her and that dreaded task once and for all!",
    "questKangarooCompletion": "“NOW!” You signal your party to throw the boomerangs back at the kangaroo. The beast hops further away with each hit until she flees, leaving nothing more than a dark red cloud of dust, a few eggs, and some gold coins.<br><br>@Mewrose walks forward to where the kangaroo once stood. “Hey, where did the boomerangs go?”<br><br>“They probably dissolved into dust, making that dark red cloud, when we finished our respective tasks,” @stefalupagus speculates.<br><br>@LilithofAlfheim squints at the horizon. “Is that another kangaroo troop heading our way?”<br><br>You all break into a run back to Habit City. Better to face your difficult tasks than take another lump to the back of the head!",

    "questAlligatorNotes": "“Crikey!” exclaims @gully. “An Insta-Gator in its natural habitat! Careful, it distracts its prey with things that seem urgent THIS INSTANT, and it feeds on the unchecked Dailies that result.” You fall silent to avoid attracting its attention, but to no avail. The Insta-Gator spots you and charges! Distracting voices rise up from Swamps of Stagnation, grabbing for your attention: “Read this post! See this photo! Pay attention to me THIS INSTANT!” You scramble to mount a counterattack, completing your Dailies and bolstering your good Habits to fight off the dreaded Insta-Gator.",
    "questAlligatorCompletion": "With your attention focused on what’s important and not the Insta-Gator’s distractions, the Insta-Gator flees. Victory! “Are those eggs? They look like gator eggs to me,” asks @mfonda. “If we care for them correctly, they’ll be loyal pets or faithful steeds,” answers @UncommonCriminal, handing you three to care for. Let’s hope so, or else the Insta-Gator might make a return…",
