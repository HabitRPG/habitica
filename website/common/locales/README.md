HabitRPG's translations are managed on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/habitrpg/).

The files in this folder are automatically pulled from Transifex, with
exception of the original American-English strings which are managed
directly through GitHub in `locales/en`.

When you need to change any text, edit only the files in `locales/en`.
Do not edit files in any other locales directory. You do not need to
request that your changes be translated; changes are automatically
copied to Transifex on a regular basis.

If you want to help with translations, please first read [Guidance for
Linguists](http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Guidance_for_Linguists) and
note especially its information about the [Translations Trello
card](https://trello.com/c/SvTsLdRF/12-translations).
