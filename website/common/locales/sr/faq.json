It’s a shared Habitica experience where tasks can be created and checked off by anyone in the group.\n\nThere are also features available like member roles, status view, and task assigning that give you a more controlled experience. [Visit our wiki](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Group_Plans) to learn more about our Group Plans’ features!\n\n## Who benefits from a Group Plan?\n\nGroup Plans work best when you have a small team of people who want to collaborate together. We recommend 2-5 members.\n\nGroup Plans are great for families, whether it’s a parent and child or you and a partner. Shared goals, chores, or responsibilities are easy to keep track of on one board.\n\nGroup Plans can also be useful for teams of colleagues that have shared goals, or managers that want to introduce their employees to gamification.\n\n## Quick tips for using Groups\n\nHere are some quick tips to get you started with your new Group. We’ll provide more details in the following sections:\n\n* Make a member a manager to give them the ability to create and edit tasks\n* Leave tasks unassigned if anyone can complete it and it only needs done once\n* Assign a task to one person to make sure no one else can complete their task\n* Assign a task to multiple people if they all need to complete it\n* Toggle the ability to display shared tasks on your personal board to not miss anything\n* You get rewarded for the tasks you complete, even multi-assigned\n* Task completion rewards aren’t shared or split between Team members\n* Use task color on the team board to judge the average completion rate of tasks\n* Regularly review the tasks on your Team Board to make sure they are still relevant\n* Missing a Daily won’t damage you or your team, but the task will degrade in color\n\n## How can others in the group create tasks?\n\nOnly the group leader and managers can create tasks. If you’d like a group member to be able to create tasks, then you should promote them to be a manager by going to the Group Information tab, viewing the member list, and clicking the dot icon by their name.\n\n## How does assigning a task work?\n\nGroup Plans give you the unique ability to assign tasks to other group members. Assigning a task is great for delegating. If you assign a task to someone, then other members are prevented from completing it.\n\nYou can also assign a task to multiple people if it needs to be completed by more than one member. For example, if everyone has to brush their teeth, create a task and assign it to each group member. They will all be able to check it off and get their individual rewards for doing so. The main task will show as complete once everyone checks it off.\n\n## How do unassigned tasks work?\n\nUnassigned tasks can be completed by anyone in the group, so leave a task unassigned to allow any member to complete it. For example, taking out the trash. Whoever takes out the trash can check off the unassigned task and it will show as completed for everyone.\n\n## How does the synchronized day reset work?\n\nShared tasks will reset at the same time for everyone to keep the shared task board in sync. This time is visible on the shared task board and is determined by the group leader’s day start time. Because shared tasks reset automatically, you will not get a chance to complete yesterday’s uncompleted shared Dailies when you check in the next morning.\n\nShared Dailies will not do damage if they are missed, however they will degrade in color to help visualize progress. We don’t want the shared experience to be a negative one!\n\n## How do I use my Group on the mobile apps?\n\nWhile the mobile apps don’t fully support all Group Plans functionality yet, you can still complete shared tasks from the iOS and Android app by copying the tasks onto your personal task board. You can switch this preference on from Settings in the mobile apps or from the group task board on the browser version. Now open and assigned shared tasks will display on your personal task board across all platforms.\n\n## What’s the difference between a Group’s shared tasks and Challenges?\n\nGroup Plan shared task boards are more dynamic than Challenges, in that they can constantly be updated and interacted with. Challenges are great if you have one set of tasks to send out to many people.\n\nGroup Plans are also a paid feature, while Challenges are available free to everyone.\n\nYou cannot assign specific tasks in Challenges, and Challenges do not have a shared day reset. In general, Challenges offer less control and direct interaction.",
    "androidFaqAnswer13": "## Kako funkcionišu Grupni planovi?\n\n[Grupni plan](/group-plans) pruža vašoj Partiji ili Gildiji pristup zajedničkoj tabli zadataka koja je slična vašoj ličnoj tabli zadataka! To je zajedničko iskustvo na Habitici gdje zadaci mogu biti kreirani i označavani kao završeni od strane bilo koga u grupi.\n\nTu su i dostupne funkcije poput uloga članova, pregleda statusa i dodjeljivanja zadataka koje vam pružaju kontrolisanije iskustvo. Za više informacija o funkcijama naših Grupnih planova, posjetite našu [wiki stranicu](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Group_Plans).\n\n## Ko ima koristi od Grupnog plana?\n\nGrupni planovi najbolje funkcionišu kada imate mali tim ljudi koji žele da sarađuju zajedno. Preporučujemo 2-5 članova.\n\nGrupni planovi su odlični za porodice, bilo da se radi o roditelju i djetetu ili vama i partneru. Zajednički ciljevi, kućni poslovi ili odgovornosti se lako prate na jednoj tabli.\n\nGrupni planovi također mogu biti korisni za timove kolega koji imaju zajedničke ciljeve, ili menadžere koji žele uvesti svoje zaposlene u gamifikaciju.\n\n## Brzi savjeti za korištenje grupa\n\nEvo nekoliko brzih savjeta kako da počnete sa svojom novom grupom. Detaljnije informacije pružit ćemo vam u sljedećim sekcijama:\n\n- Postavite nekog člana kao menadžera kako biste im dali mogućnost kreiranja i uređivanja zadataka.\n- Ostavite zadatke bez dodijeljenih članova ako ih bilo ko može završiti i ako se moraju obaviti samo jednom.\n- Dodijelite zadatak jednoj osobi kako biste se osigurali da ga niko drugi neće završiti.\n- Dodijelite zadatak više ljudi ako ga svi trebaju završiti.\n- Omogućite prikazivanje zajedničkih zadataka na vašoj ličnoj tabli kako ne biste ništa propustili.\n- Dobivate nagrade za zadatke koje završite, čak i ako su dodijeljeni više ljudi.\n- Nagrade za završene zadatke se ne dijele između članova tima.\n- Koristite boju zadatka na timskoj tabli da biste procijenili prosječnu stopu završetka zadataka.\n- Redovno pregledavajte zadatke na vašoj timskoj tabli kako biste se uvjerili da su i dalje relevantni.\n- Propuštanje dnevne obaveze vam ili vašem timu neće nanijeti štetu, ali će zadatak izblijedjeti u boji.\n\n## Kako drugi članovi grupe mogu kreirati zadatke?\n\nSamo vođa grupe i menadžeri mogu kreirati zadatke. Ako želite da član grupe može kreirati zadatke, trebate ga promovirati u menadžera tako što ćete otići na karticu Informacije o grupi, pregledati listu članova i kliknuti na tačkicu pored njihovog imena.\n\n## Kako funkcioniše dodjeljivanje zadatka?\n\nGrupni planovi vam omogućavaju jedinstvenu mogućnost dodjeljivanja zadataka drugim članovima grupe. Dodjeljivanje zadatka je odlično za delegiranje. Ako dodijelite zadatak nekome, ostali članovi su spriječeni da ga završe.\n\nTakođe možete dodijeliti zadatak više ljudi ako ga treba završiti više članova. Na primjer, ako svi trebaju oprati zube, kreirajte zadatak i dodijelite ga svakom članu grupe. Svi će moći da ga označe kao završen i dobiti individualne nagrade za to. Glavni zadatak će biti označen kao završen kada ga svi članovi označe.\n\n## Kako funkcionišu zadaci bez dodijeljenih članova?\n\nZadaci bez dodijeljenih članova mogu biti završeni od strane bilo kojeg člana grupe, stoga ostavite zadatak bez dodijeljenja kako bi ga bilo koji član mogao završiti. Na primjer, iznošenje smeća. Bilo ko sto iznese smeće može označiti zadatak kao završen, a to će biti vidljivo za sve.\n\n## Kako funkcioniše sinhronizovani resetovanje dana?\n\nZajednički zadaci će se resetovati istovremeno za sve kako bi se održala sinhronizacija na zajedničkoj tabli zadataka. Vrijeme resetovanja je vidljivo na zajedničkoj tabli zadataka i određuje se prema vremenu početka dana vođe grupe. Budući da se zajednički zadaci automatski resetuju, nećete imati priliku završiti nezavršene dnevne zadatke iz prethodnog dana kada se prijavite sljedećeg jutra.\n\nAko propustite zajedničku dnevnu obavezu, nećete dobiti štetu, ali će zadatak izblijediti u boji kako bi se vizualizirao napredak. Ne želimo da zajedničko iskustvo bude negativno!\n\n## Kako koristiti svoju grupu na mobilnim aplikacijama?\n\nIako mobilne aplikacije još uvijek u potpunosti ne podržavaju sve funkcionalnosti Grupnih planova, i dalje možete završiti zajedničke zadatke putem iOS i Android aplikacija tako što ćete kopirati zadatke na vašu ličnu tablu zadataka. Možete uključiti ovu opciju u Postavkama mobilnih aplikacija ili sa zajedničke table zadataka na verziji pregledača. Sada će se otvoreni i dodijeljeni zajednički zadaci prikazivati na vašoj ličnoj tabli zadataka na svim platformama.\n\n## Koja je razlika između zajedničkih zadataka grupe i Izazova?\n\nZajedničke table zadataka Grupnih planova su dinamičnije od Izazova, jer se stalno mogu ažurirati i interaktovati. Izazovi su odlični ako imate jedan set zadataka koje želite poslati mnogim ljudima.\n\nGrupni planovi su plaćena opcija, dok su Izazovi besplatni i dostupni svima.\n\nNe možete dodijeliti specifične zadatke u Izazovima, a Izazovi nemaju sinhronizovano resetovanje dana. Generalno gledano, Izazovi pružaju manju kontrolu i direktnu interakciju.",
