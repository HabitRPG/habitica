  "webStep1Text": "Habitica is nothing without real-world goals, so enter a few tasks. You can add more later as you think of them! All tasks can be added by clicking the green \"Create\" button.\n* **Set up [To-Dos](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/To-Dos):** Enter tasks you do once or rarely in the To-Dos column, one at a time. You can click on the tasks to edit them and add checklists, due dates, and more!\n* **Set up [Dailies](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Dailies):** Enter activities you need to do daily or on a particular day of the week, month, or year in the Dailies column. Click task to edit when it will be due and/or set a start date. You can also make it due on a repeating basis, for example, every 3 days.\n* **Set up [Habits](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Habits):** Enter habits you want to establish in the Habits column. You can edit the Habit to change it to just a good habit :heavy_plus_sign: or a bad habit :heavy_minus_sign:\n* **Set up [Rewards](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Rewards):** In addition to the in-game Rewards offered, add activities or treats which you want to use as a motivation to the Rewards column. It's important to give yourself a break or allow some indulgence in moderation!\n* If you need inspiration for which tasks to add, you can look at the wiki's pages on [Sample Habits](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_Habits), [Sample Dailies](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_Dailies), [Sample To-Dos](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_To-Dos), and [Sample Rewards](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_Custom_Rewards).",

  "step2": "Krok 2: Získaj body za urobenie veci v reálnom živote",
  "webStep2Text": "Now, start tackling your goals from the list! As you complete tasks and check them off in Habitica, you will gain [Experience](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Experience_Points), which helps you level up, and [Gold](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Gold_Points), which allows you to purchase Rewards. If you fall into bad habits or miss your Dailies, you will lose [Health](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Health_Points). In that way, the Habitica Experience and Health bars serve as a fun indicator of your progress toward your goals. You'll start seeing your real life improve as your character advances in the game.",

  "step3": "Krok 3: Prispôsob si a preskúmaj Habitiku",
