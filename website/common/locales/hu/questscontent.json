Please, let me offer you some of this delicious tea.”<br><br>“That’s…” @Kiwibot begins. “That’s MY—“<br><br>“Yes, yes, of course,” says the April Fool, helping himself to some cookies. “Just thought I’d pop indoors and get a nice reprieve from all the tornado-summoning skulls.” He takes a casual sip from his teacup. “Incidentally, the city of Mistiflying is under attack.”<br><br>Horrified, you and your friends race to the Stables and saddle your fastest winged mounts. As you soar towards the floating city, you see that a swarm of chattering, flying skulls are laying siege to the city… and several turn their attentions towards you!",

After a desperate search for the April Fool, you find him inside a cottage, blithely playing cards with an angry, trussed-up skull.<br><br>@Katy133 raises their voice over the whistling wind. “What’s causing this? We defeated the skulls, but it’s getting worse!”<br><br>“That is a pickle,” the April Fool agrees. “Please be a dear and don’t mention it to Lady Glaciate. She’s always threatening to call off our courtship on the grounds that I am ‘catastrophically irresponsible,’ and I fear that she might misread this situation.” He shuffles the deck. “Perhaps you might follow the Mistiflies? They’re immaterial, so the wind can’t blow them away, and they tend to swarm around threats.” He nods out the window, where several of the city’s patron creatures are fluttering towards the east. “Now let me concentrate — my opponent has quite the poker face.”",

Squinting, you spot a many-winged silhouette floating at the center of the tremendous storm.<br><br>“Oh, dear,” the April Fool sighs, nearly drowned out by the howl of the weather. “Looks like Winny went and got himself possessed. Very relatable problem, that. Could happen to anybody.”<br><br>“The Wind-Worker!” @Beffymaroo hollers at you. “He’s Mistiflying’s most talented messenger-mage, since he’s so skilled with weather magic. Normally he’s a very polite mailman!”<br><br>As if to counteract this statement, the Wind-Worker lets out a scream of fury, and even with your magic robes, the storm nearly rips you from your mount.<br><br>“That gaudy mask is new,” the April Fool remarks. “Perhaps you should relieve him of it?”<br><br>It’s a good idea… but the enraged mage isn’t going to give it up without a fight.",
    "questMayhemMistiflying3Completion": "Just as you think you can’t withstand the wind any longer, you manage to snatch the mask from the Wind-Worker’s face. Instantly, the tornado is sucked away, leaving only balmy breezes and sunshine. The Wind-Worker looks around in bemusement. “Where did she go?”<br><br>“Who?” your friend @khdarkwolf asks.<br><br>“That sweet woman who offered to deliver a package for me. Tzina.” As he takes in the wind-swept city below him, his expression darkens. “Then again, maybe she wasn’t so sweet…”<br><br>The April Fool pats him on the back, then hands you two shimmering envelopes. “Here. Why don’t you let this distressed fellow rest, and take charge of the mail for a bit? I hear the magic in those envelopes will make them worth your while.”",

Even the Joyful Reaper looks somber.<br><br>“Oho, you’re here,” says the April Fool. “Now, we would not rouse you from your rest without a truly dire—”<br><br>“Help us investigate the recent bout of possessions,” interrupts Lady Glaciate. “All the victims blamed someone named Tzina.”<br><br>The April Fool is clearly affronted by the summary. “What about my speech?” he hisses to her. “With the fog and thunderstorm effects?”<br><br>“We’re in a hurry,” she mutters back. “And my mammoths are still soggy from your incessant practicing.”<br><br>“I’m afraid that the esteemed Master of Warriors is correct,” says King Manta. “Time is of the essence. Will you aid us?”<br><br>When you nod, he waves his hands to open a portal, revealing an underwater room. “Swim down with me to Dilatory, and we will scour my library for any references that might give us a clue.” At your look of confusion, he adds, “Don’t worry, the paper was enchanted long before Dilatory sank. None of the books are the slightest bit damp!” He winks.“Unlike Lady Glaciate’s mammoths.”<br><br>“I heard that, Manta.”<br><br>As you dive into the water after the Master of Mages, your legs magically fuse into fins.

I might have guessed, considering the attacks by reanimated skulls during each incident.” Her assistant @tricksy.fox brings in a chest, and you are startled to see the contents that @beffymaroo unloads: the very same objects once used by this mysterious Tzina to possess people.<br><br>“I’m going to use resonant healing magic to try to make this creature manifest,” the Joyful Reaper says, reminding you that the skeleton is a somewhat unconventional Healer. “You’ll need to read the revealed information quickly, in case it breaks loose.”<br><br>As she concentrates, a twisting mist begins to siphon from the books and twine around the objects. Quickly, you flip through the pages, trying to read the new lines of text that are writhing into view. You catch only a few snippets: “Sands of the Timewastes” — “the Great Disaster” —“split into four”— “permanently corrupted”— before a single name catches your eye: Zinnya.<br><br>Abruptly, the pages wrench free from your fingers and shred themselves as a howling creature explodes into being, coalescing around the possessed objects.<br><br>“It’s an a’Voidant!” the Joyful Reaper shouts, throwing up a protection spell. “They’re ancient creatures of confusion and obscurity. If this Tzina can control one, she must have a frightening command over life magic. Quickly, attack it before it escapes back into the books!”<br><br>",
    "questLostMasterclasser2Completion": "The a’Voidant succumbs at last, and you share the snippets that you read.<br><br>“None of those references sound familiar, even for someone as old as I,” the Joyful Reaper says. “Except… the Timewastes are a distant desert at the most hostile edge of Habitica. Portals often fail nearby, but swift mounts could get you there in no time. Lady Glaciate will be glad to assist.” Her voice grows amused. “Which means that the enamored Master of Rogues will undoubtedly tag along.” She hands you the glimmering mask. “Perhaps you should try to track the lingering magic in these items to its source.

Just imagine the possibilities. This must be the work of a truly stealthy Rogue.”<br><br>“A Rogue who could be watching us,” says Lady Glaciate, dismounting and raising her spear. “If there’s a head-on attack, try not to irritate our opponent. I don’t want a repeat of the volcano incident.”<br><br>He beams at her. “But it was one of your most resplendent rescues.”<br><br>To your surprise, Lady Glaciate turns very pink at the compliment. She hastily stomps away to examine the ruins.<br><br>“Looks like the wreck of an ancient city,” says @AnnDeLune. “I wonder what…”<br><br>Before she can finish her sentence, a portal roars open in the sky.

These four are a mockery, each possessing only a fragment of what I once had! I commanded every spell and learned every skill. I shaped your very world to my whim — until the traitorous aether itself collapsed under the weight of my talents and my perfectly reasonable expectations. I have been trapped for millennia in this resulting void, recuperating. Imagine my disgust when I learned how my legacy had been corrupted.” She lets out a low, echoing laugh. “My plan was to destroy their domains before destroying them, but I suppose the order is irrelevant.” With a burst of uncanny strength, she charges forward, and the Realm of Void explodes into chaos.",

The thrashing void stills around her as she slumps forward, and for a moment, she seems to change, becoming younger, calmer, with an expression of peace upon her face… but then everything melts away with scarcely a whisper, and you’re kneeling once more in the desert sand.<br><br>“It seems that we have much to learn about our own history,” King Manta says, staring at the broken ruins. “After the Master Aethermancer grew overwhelmed and lost control of her abilities, the outpouring of void must have leached the life from the entire land. Everything probably became deserts like this.”<br><br>“No wonder the ancients who founded Habitica stressed a balance of productivity and wellness,” the Joyful Reaper murmurs. “Rebuilding their world would have been a daunting task requiring considerable hard work, but they would have wanted to prevent such a catastrophe from happening again.”<br><br>“Oho, look at those formerly possessed items!” says the April Fool. Sure enough, all of them shimmer with a pale, glimmering translucence from the final burst of aether released when you laid Anti’zinnya’s spirit to rest. “What a dazzling effect. I must take notes.”<br><br>“The concentrated remnants of aether in this area probably caused these animals to go invisible, too,” says Lady Glaciate, scratching a patch of emptiness behind the ears. You feel an unseen fluffy head nudge your hand, and suspect that you’ll have to do some explaining at the Stables back home. As you look at the ruins one last time, you spot all that remains of the first Masterclasser: her shimmering cloak.
