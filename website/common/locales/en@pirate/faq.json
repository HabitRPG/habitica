    "faqQuestion12": "How can ye battle a World Boss?",
    "iosFaqAnswer12": "World Bosses are special monsters that appear in the Tavern. All active users are automatically battling the Boss, and their tasks and Skills will damage the Boss as usual.\n\n You can also be in a normal Quest at the same time. Your tasks and Skills will count towards both the World Boss and the Boss/Collection Quest in your party.\n\n A World Boss will never hurt you or your account in any way. Instead, it has a Rage Bar that fills when users skip Dailies. If its Rage bar fills, it will attack one of the Non-Player Characters around the site and their image will change.\n\n You can read more about [past World Bosses](http://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/World_Bosses) on the wiki.",
