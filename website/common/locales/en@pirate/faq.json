All active users are automatically battling th' Boss, an' their tasks an' skills will damage the Boss as usual.\n<br><br>\n Ye can also be in a normal Adventure at th' same time. Yer tasks an' skills will count towards both th' World Boss an' th' Boss/Collection Adventure in yer crew.\n<br><br>\n A World Boss will never hurt ye or yer account in any way. Instead, it has a Rage Bar that fills when users skip Dailies. If its Rage bar fills, it will attack one o' th' Non-Player Characters around th' site an' their image will change.\n<br><br>\n Ye can read more about [past World Bosses](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/World_Bosses) on th' wiki.",
