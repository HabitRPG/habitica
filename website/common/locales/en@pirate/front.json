    "pkQuestion1": "What was th' insper-ation fer Habitica? How'd it start?",
    "pkAnswer1": "If ye’ve ever invested time in levelin' up a character in a game, it be hard not ta wonder how great yer life would be iffen ye put all o' that effort inta improving yer real-life self instead of yer avatar. We started buildin' Habitica t' address that question. <br /> Habitica officially launched wit' a Kickstarter in 2013, an' th' idea really took off. Since then, it be grown inta a huge project, supported by our awesome open-source volunteers and our generous users.",
    "pkQuestion2": "Why's Habitica workin'?",
    "pkAnswer2": "Formin' a new 'abit be 'ard cuz people really need th' obvious, instant reward. Fer example, it be tough ta start flossin', cuz even though our den-tist be tellin' us that it be healthier in th' long run, at th' time it just makes yer gums hurt. <br /> Habitica's gamification be addin' a sense o' instant gratification t' ever'day objectives by rewardin' a tough task wit' experience, gold… and mebbe even a random prize, like a dragon egg! This helps ta keep people motivated e'en when th' task itself don't have a built-in reward, and we be seein' people been turnin' their lives around as a result. Ye kin check out success stories here: https://habitversary.tumblr.com",
    "pkQuestion3": "Why did ye add social features?",
    "pkAnswer3": "Social pressure be a huge motivatin' factor fer a lot o' people, so we knew that we want'd t' have a strong community that would hold each other accountable fer their goals an' cheer fer their successes. Luckily, one o' th' thin's that multiplayer video games do best be foster a sense o' community among their users! Habitica’s community structure borrows from these types o' games; ye can form a small Crew o' close friends, but ye can also join a larger, shar'd-interest groups known as a Guild. Although some users choose t' play solo, most decide t' form a support network that encourages social accountability through features such as Adventures, where Crew members pool their productivity t' battle monsters together.",
    "pkQuestion4": "Why does skippin' tasks remove yer avatar’s health?",
    "pkAnswer4": "If ye skip one o' yer daily goals, yer avatar will lose health th' followin' day. This serves as an important motivatin' factor t' encourage people t' follow through wit' their goals because people  really hate hurtin' their little avatar! Plus, th' social accountability be critical fer a lot o' people: if ye’re fightin' a monster wit' yer friends, skippin' yer tasks hurts their avatars, too.",
    "pkQuestion5": "What distinguishes Habitica from oth'r gamification programs?",
    "pkAnswer5": "One o' th' ways that Habitica has been most successful at usin' gamification be that we've put a lot o' effort into thinkin' about th' game aspects t' ensure that they actually be fun. We've also includ'd many social components, because we feel that some o' th' most motivatin' games let ye play wit' friends, an' because research has shown that it's easier t' form habits when ye have accountability t' other people.",
    "pkQuestion6": "Who be th' typical pirate o' Habitica?",
    "pkAnswer6": "Lots o' different people use Habitica! More than half o' our users be ages 18 t' 34, but we have grandparents usin' th' site wit' their young grandkids an' ev'ry age in-between. Often families will join a party an' battle monsters together. <br /> Many o' our users have a background in games, but surprisin'ly, when we ran a survey a while back, 40% o' our users identifi'd as non-gamers! So it looks like our method can be effective fer anyone who wants productivity an' wellness t' feel more fun.",
    "pkQuestion7": "Why does Habitica use pixel art?",
    "pkAnswer7": "Habitica uses pixel art fer several reasons. In addition t' th' fun nostalgia factor, pixel art be very approachable t' our volunteer artists who want t' chip in. 'Tis much easier t' keep our pixel art consistent even when lots o' different artists contribute, an' it lets us quickly generate a ton o' new content!",
