    "pkQuestion1": "What was th' insper-ation fer Habitica? How'd it start?",
    "pkAnswer1": "If ye’ve ever invested time in levelin' up a character in a game, it be hard not ta wonder how great yer life would be iffen ye put all o' that effort inta improving yer real-life self instead of yer avatar. We started buildin' Habitica t' address that question. <br /> Habitica officially launched wit' a Kickstarter in 2013, an' th' idea really took off. Since then, it be grown inta a huge project, supported by our awesome open-source volunteers and our generous users.",
    "pkQuestion2": "Why's Habitica workin'?",
    "pkAnswer2": "Formin' a new 'abit be 'ard cuz people really need th' obvious, instant reward. Fer example, it be tough ta start flossin', cuz even though our den-tist be tellin' us that it be healthier in th' long run, at th' time it just makes yer gums hurt. <br /> Habitica's gamification be addin' a sense o' instant gratification t' ever'day objectives by rewardin' a tough task wit' experience, gold… and mebbe even a random prize, like a dragon egg! This helps ta keep people motivated e'en when th' task itself don't have a built-in reward, and we be seein' people been turnin' their lives around as a result. Ye kin check out success stories here: https://habitversary.tumblr.com",
    "pkQuestion3": "Why did ye add social features?",
    "pkAnswer3": "Social pressure is a huge motivating factor for a lot of people, so we knew that we wanted to have a strong community that would hold each other accountable for their goals and cheer for their successes. Luckily, one of the things that multiplayer video games do best is foster a sense of community among their users! Habitica’s community structure borrows from these types of games; you can form a small Party of close friends, but you can also join a larger, shared-interest groups known as a Guild. Although some users choose to play solo, most decide to form a support network that encourages social accountability through features such as Quests, where Party members pool their productivity to battle monsters together.",
    "pkQuestion4": "Why does skipping tasks remove your avatar’s health?",
    "pkAnswer4": "If you skip one of your daily goals, your avatar will lose health the following day. This serves as an important motivating factor to encourage people to follow through with their goals because people  really hate hurting their little avatar! Plus, the social accountability is critical for a lot of people: if you’re fighting a monster with your friends, skipping your tasks hurts their avatars, too.",
    "pkQuestion5": "What distinguishes Habitica from other gamification programs?",
    "pkAnswer5": "One of the ways that Habitica has been most successful at using gamification is that we've put a lot of effort into thinking about the game aspects to ensure that they are actually fun. We've also included many social components, because we feel that some of the most motivating games let you play with friends, and because research has shown that it's easier to form habits when you have accountability to other people.",
    "pkQuestion6": "Who is the typical user of Habitica?",
    "pkAnswer6": "Lots of different people use Habitica! More than half of our users are ages 18 to 34, but we have grandparents using the site with their young grandkids and every age in-between. Often families will join a party and battle monsters together. <br /> Many of our users have a background in games, but surprisingly, when we ran a survey a while back, 40% of our users identified as non-gamers! So it looks like our method can be effective for anyone who wants productivity and wellness to feel more fun.",
    "pkQuestion7": "Why does Habitica use pixel art?",
    "pkAnswer7": "Habitica uses pixel art for several reasons. In addition to the fun nostalgia factor, pixel art is very approachable to our volunteer artists who want to chip in. It's much easier to keep our pixel art consistent even when lots of different artists contribute, and it lets us quickly generate a ton of new content!",
