        p We're excited to announce that we've released two new tools that will help keep Habitica's Tavern Chat pleasant to use as our community grows.
        br
        p First is a swearword blocker that will automatically prevent people from posting certain words that are not allowed in the Tavern Chat, which will help keep conversations suitable for Habiticans of all ages and backgrounds. (Please note that the swearword blocker may not catch every instance of disallowed words, so we still encourage users to flag inappropriate messages so that they can be removed by the moderator team!) Next, there's a new tool for spam prevention that keeps users from posting too many messages too quickly in the Tavern Chat. This prevents a single person from dominating the chat and pushing away older messages before others have a chance to read them.
        br
        p We're very excited to have these new features! We hope that you enjoy the chat improvements that will result.

        p We've launched the beta version of a very exciting feature: <a href='/#/options/groups/group-plans'>Group Plans</a>!
        br
        p Group Plans let you create and manage a shared task list for a group of people. They include a bunch of cool features designed for teams, families, or anyone with overlapping tasks. With Group Plans, you can:
        br
        ul
          li Create a shared task list for the group that everyone can easily view and edit.
          li Assign tasks to group members
          li Claim a task that you are working on
          li Mark tasks that require special approval, so that you can verify that they really were done
        br
        p More features will be coming soon!
        br
        p Group Plans can be accessed by upgrading a private Guild that you already own, or by <a href='/#/options/groups/guilds/create'>creating a new one</a>. Because these features are more involved, Group Plans are a monthly paid plan, with a recurring price of $9 every month + $3 a month for every additional group member. This will let us afford to keep building out Group Plan features and the free version of Habitica at the same time.
        br
        p Group Plans are still in beta, so we're eager to hear feedback from you about what kinds of changes you want to see. Let us know in an email to <a href='mailto:admin@habitica.com' target='_blank'>admin@habitica.com</a>!

        h3 Changes to Orb of Rebirth
        p The Orb of Rebirth, a special item in the <a href='/#/options/inventory/drops'>Market</a>, will now cost 6 Gems instead of 8, and will not remove any Equipment items! It will still be available for free to users of Level 100 and above. If you've used the Orb of Rebirth in the past and would like your Equipment restored, let us know in the <a href='/#/options/groups/guilds/a29da26b-37de-4a71-b0c6-48e72a900dac'>Report a Bug Guild</a> and we'll fix things up for you!
        br
        p We've made this change in response to feedback suggesting Rebirth could be improved. Previously, Rebirth made the Rewards list too long and re-earning the gold to recover all the equipment was daunting, particularly when it came to seasonal Grand Gala gear. We hope this modification works to alleviate these concerns and that Rebirth is a feature that continues to motivate everyone.
        br
        p For those who do want to release and buy back all their Equipment, we are developing a separate feature, tentatively titled "Empty the Armory." Stay tuned!

        p To protect the accounts of Habiticans in different time zones across the world, we enabled Cron Daily Safe Mode during the maintenance, which will prevent you from taking any damage or losing any streaks for the rest of the weekend. Let us know at <a href='mailto:admin@habitica.com' target='_blank'>admin@habitica.com</a> if you have any questions or concerns!

        h3 Maintenance to Take Place May 21
        p This Saturday, we will be performing important maintenance on Habitica to build out the groundwork for some exciting upcoming features! We'll be doing everything we can to make this as smooth as possible, but unfortunately, there will be significant downtime for much of the day.
        br
        p.strong We expect that on Saturday, May 21st, Habitica will be unavailable between <a href='http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?pl=1&lid=5368361,100&h=5368361' target='_blank'>1 PM and 10 PM Pacific Time (8 pm - 5 am UTC)</a>.
        ul
          li Don't worry, <strong>you will NOT lose any streaks or take any damage during this weekend, not even from Bosses!</strong> This maintenance will not harm your accounts.
          li If you will need to see your task list on Saturday, <strong>we recommend taking a screenshot of your tasks before the maintenance begins</strong> so that you can use them as a reference during downtime.
          li At the end of the maintenance, to thank people for their patience, <strong>everyone will receive a rare Veteran pet!</strong>
          li This maintenance should not result in any major visible differences to the site; it's all behind-the-scenes work. However, <strong>at the end of it, we will release new updates to the mobile apps, which will be required in order for the apps to work properly with the new changes!</strong> Be sure to download those updates on Saturday as soon as they are released.
          li For more information, please <strong>check out our detailed <a href='/static/maintenance-info'>info page</a> about the maintenance!</strong> And if you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to Leslie (<a href='mailto:leslie@habitica.com' target='_blank'>leslie@habitica.com</a>), and she will be happy to help you.
        p We understand that it's very frustrating to have Habitica unavailable for such a long part of the day. Rest assured that we'll be doing everything we can to make the maintenance go as quickly as possible, but with over a million Habitican accounts to migrate, this is a hefty task! During the maintenance on Saturday we will be posting regular status reports on our <a href='https://twitter.com/habitica' target='_blank'>Twitter account</a>, so you can follow us for the most accurate updates.
        br
        p Thank you for your patience, and for using Habitica!

        h3 The Be-Wilder World Boss is Defeated!
        p We've done it! The Be-Wilder lets out a ululating cry as it twists in the air, shedding feathers like falling rain. Slowly, gradually, it coils into a cloud of sparkling mist. As the newly-revealed sun pierces the fog, it burns away, revealing the coughing, mercifully human forms of Bailey, Matt, Alex.... and the April Fool himself.
    tr
      td
        h3 Mistiflying is Saved!
        p The April Fool has enough shame to look a bit sheepish. “Oh, hm,” he says. “Perhaps I got a little…. carried away.”
        br
        p The crowd mutters. Sodden flowers wash up on sidewalks. Somewhere in the distance, a roof collapses with a spectacular splash.
        br
        p “Er, yes,” the April Fool says. “That is. What I meant to say was, I’m dreadfully sorry.” He heaves a sigh. “I suppose it can’t all be fun and games, after all. It might not hurt to focus occasionally. Maybe I’ll get a head start on next year’s pranking.”
        br
        p Redphoenix coughs meaningfully.
        br
        p “I mean, get a head start on this year’s spring cleaning!” the April Fool says. “Nothing to fear, I’ll have Habit City in spit-shape soon. Luckily nobody is better than I at dual-wielding mops.”

        br
        p As Habiticans cuddle the magical fuzzy bees, the April Fool’s eyes light up. “Oho, I’ve had a thought! Why don’t you all keep some of these Magical Bee Pets and Mounts? It’s a gift that perfectly symbolizes the balance between hard work and sweet rewards, if I’m going to get all boring and allegorical on you.” He winks. “Besides, they don’t have stingers! Fool’s honor.”

        br
        p “My dearest friends, why so alarmed?” crows the Be-Wilder, beating its wings. “There’s no need to toil for your rewards any more. I’ll just give you all the things that you desire!”

        p Some concerned citizens broach the issue with the April Fool, but he just chortles and raises his voice to be heard over the trombones. “Oho! Nothing to fear. I’ve discovered a trick that will keep us reaping our just rewards, even as we continue to celebrate! Just you wait and see. I’m saving it as my grand finale!”

        p Mistiflying is a flower-filled city that drifts in the clouds above Habitica, manufacturing custom rewards and raining them down on deserving Habiticans. It’s brimming with friendly, magical bees that work hard to keep the blossoms healthy and the city floating, and there’s a festive humming in the air. Looks like we’ll get a chance for plenty of parties this month! We’ve even received a visit from Mistiflying’s somewhat erratic ruler: the April Fool, a masterful rogue with a penchant for fun and an interest in illusions.

        p The April Fool swishes his cape over his shoulders, striding through the mists into Habit City. “Lemoness! Redphoenix! SabreCat! My dearest and most delightful friends!” He sweeps out his arms in a striking pose, and several firework displays go off behind him. “Oho, look at your faces! It’s like you aren’t even happy to see me.”
        br
        p Lemoness does, in fact, seem less than thrilled. “It’s just… the last time you were here, I was kidnapped by a mutant flower uprising."
        br
        p “Really! Did I cause that?”
        br
        p Redphoenix smolders. “Two years ago, you turned me into an eggplant.”
        br
        p “An honest misunderstanding, I am sure. But it did only last a single day!”
        The April Fool links his arm with SabreCat and gives the tracker a winning smile. “Which reminds me – Sabe, I can crash in your guest cottage again this month, right? No hard feelings about the Mammoth Ballet incident?”
        br
        p SabreCat lets out a strangled growl, and Lemoness hastily pulls the April Fool out of claw range.
        br
        p “You’re here for a whole month?” Redphoenix says. "What, did Lady Glaciate banish you from the Stoïkalm Steppes again?"
        br
        p The April Fool seems affronted at the suggestion. "Rumors, hearsay, and probably lies! Still, Habit City may temporarily be a more hospitable place to hover over. For entirely unrelated reasons, you understand."
        br
        p Lemoness rubs her temples.“Even so. It's not that we don’t... appreciate your yearly creativity, but we’re in the middle of the Spring Fling festivities. It’s a very busy time!!”
        br
        p He taps her affectionately on the nose. “Nothing to fear, my citrusy dear! Believe me, you won’t even notice I’m here.”
        br
        p Then he claps his hands, and a marching band starts up.

        p Burnout has been defeated! All Habiticans have received rewards, including a phoenix pet and mount, assorted candies, and the Savior of the Flourishing Fields achievement. Well done! Here's how it happened:
        br
        p With a great, soft sigh, Burnout slowly releases the ardent energy that was fueling its fire. As the monster curls quietly into ashes, its stolen energy shimmers through the air, rejuvenating the Exhaust Spirits and returning them to their true forms.
        br
        p Ian, Daniel, and the Seasonal Sorceress cheer as Habiticans rush to greet them, and all the missing citizens of the Flourishing Fields embrace their friends and families. The final Exhaust Spirit transforms into the Joyful Reaper herself!
        br
        p "Look!" whispers @Baconsaur, as the ashes begin to glitter. Slowly, they resolve into hundreds of shining phoenixes!
        br
        p One of glowing birds alights on the Joyful Reaper's skeletal arm, and she grins at it. "It has been a long time since I've had the exquisite privilege to behold a phoenix in the Flourishing Fields," she says. "Although given recent occurrences, I must say, this is highly thematically appropriate!"
        br
        p Her tone sobers, although (naturally) her grin remains. "We're known for being hard-working here, but we are also known for our feasts and festivities. Rather ironic, I suppose, that as we strove to plan a spectacular party, we refused to permit ourselves any time for fun. We certainly won't make the same mistake twice!"
        br
        p She claps her hands. "Now - let's celebrate!"

        p Last minute preparations for the Fall Festival are underway! Lemoness has been bustling about with tomes of potion-brewing, and conferring with the artisans in cheerful conspiracy. SabreCat has been seen in the smithy, toiling on projects that he has loudly announced to be "very hush-hush." Even the elusive Royal Chancellor, Redphoenix, has taken a break from sending Boring Business Letters to roast marshmallows outside the Tavern. Everyone has happily gathered around her little campfire, which she is feeding with a steady supply of envelopes.
        br
        p Only one thing has disrupted the anticipation. You catch Lemoness frowning as she reads a message attached to the latest shipment from the Flourishing Fields.
        br
        p "They're apologizing for not sending as many pumpkins as they promised, due to an 'unanticipated setback,'" she explains. "There's no need for them to be sorry, though -- they've sent us hundreds already! They said the same thing last week about the candy vegetable harvest. I told the Joyful Reaper not to worry about it, but she just promises to work harder."
        br
        p Well, soon the Festival will launch, and they'll be able to take a break. Nothing to be concerned about!

        h3 New iOS App: Habitica!
        p We are proud to announce the beta release of our new native iOS app: <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/habitica/id994882113?ls=1&mt=8' target='_blank'>Habitica</a>! It features an all-new interface, smoother performance, reminders to complete Dailies, and tons of features including skills and better party chat! <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/habitica/id994882113?ls=1&mt=8' target='_blank'>Click here to download it</a> - it's a new app, not an upgrade of the clunky old one.
        br
        p This is a beta release, so please report any issues using the in-app Send Feedback and Report a Bug buttons, under Menu > About. <a href='https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg-ios/' target='_blank'>The repository is open source</a>, so anyone can jump in and help out.

    tr
      td
        h3 Why Habitica?
        p Habitica is the land where HabitRPG takes place - a land where players ride dragons and slay Dailies. Plus, it's now the name of the mobile app. Soon, it will also be the name of the site!
        br
        p The decision to switch from HabitRPG to Habitica is a big one, and we've been talking it over for a long time. We've gotten feedback since the beginning that it was confusing, especially for the many people who aren't familiar with the acronym. ("HabitPGR? HabitRZG? What was your name again?") We feel that "Habitica" keeps the fantasy flair without the confusing abbreviation, so it's the best of both realms.
        br
        p So far, habitica.com redirects to habitrpg.com, and it's the name of the native mobile apps. Look forward to an upcoming announcement of the switchover date, when we will be ringing in the name change with our inaugural Habitica Day celebration!

        br
        p It used to be that the Resting in the Inn froze all your Dailies so that they wouldn't refresh the next day - even for important Dailies like "take medicine" or "feed pets." This was very frustrating to a lot of users who relied on these features, even during periods of time when they needed to rest in the Inn for finals, illness, vacation, etc.
        br
        p Now if you're in a situation, for example finals period, where you don't have the time or energy to do most of your Dailies, you can still complete some of them every day while Resting in the Inn. It's much more flexible and convenient!
        br
        p If you're in a quest, you still won't deal damage/collect items until you check out of the Inn, and your Dailies will not damage your party members, but you can still be injured by a Boss if your Party mates skip their own Dailies. You also still do not gain Mana overnight until you check out of the Inn. If you have any questions about how Resting in the Inn works, be sure to ask in the <a href='https://habitrpg.com/#/options/groups/guilds/5481ccf3-5d2d-48a9-a871-70a7380cee5a' target='_blank'>Newbies Guild!</a>

  h2 5/01/2015 - Skills Rebalancing
    hr
    tr
      td
        p After over a year's worth of complaints on Trello and countless bug reports on Github, and after almost five months of dedicated debating, coding, and testing, we have finally rolled out an overhaul of the skills and mana system. Thank you so much to everyone who contributed opinions, time, and effort! Here's what happened:
    tr
      td
        h3 HABITS DAMAGE BOSSES
        p Now it's even easier to damage a Boss without skills! It was definitely high time that HabitRPG counted Habits towards battles. We were not living up to our name.
    tr
      td
        h3 MANA DIRECTLY LINKED TO PROGRESS
        p Mana was pretty broken: you gained it overnight no matter what you'd done the day before, and it was only linked to To-Dos. This meant that using skills was pretty detached from how well you were doing in your real life, which defeated the purpose of the game!
        p Now you can gain Mana from Dailies and positive Habits as well as To-Dos! You still gain Mana overnight, but how much you gain depends on how many of your Dailies you did.
        p You can also lose Mana by hitting negative Habits. Yikes! Better not indulge...
    tr
      td
        h3 SKILLS STRENGTHENED AND WEAKENED
        p Some notoriously overpowered skills have been weakened, like Backstab (which often granted over 1000GP per cast), Burst of Flames (which allowed you to 1-hit KO most bosses regardless of how much or how little you'd done that day), and Valorous Presence (which caused the notorious "I checked off one Daily and gained 997 levels" bug reports).
        p Some painfully UNDERpowered skills have been strengthened, such as Tools of the Trade and Searing Brightness. We think you'll like these much better now!
        p For a full description of what changed, <a href='http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:LadyAlys/Skills_Rebalancing_and_Other_Changes' target='_blank'>check out this blog post</a>.
    tr
      td
        h3 GIVING FEEDBACK
        p We understand that these changes may be disruptive to some of you. We're sorry! We hope that with time, you will find them to be a drastic improvement. We will be waiting two weeks (so that everyone can get used to the new system), and then on May 15th will open up a new Trello card for comments and feedback.
        p For those of you who want to reallocate stats now that you have the new system, please post your User ID in this <a href='https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/issues/5082' target='_blank'>Github ticket</a>. (Your UUID is found under Settings > API; do NOT post your API Token.) That ticket is also being used to debate a possibility to make it so that reallocating stats does not cost gems. If that's a feature you would like (or would hate), definitely drop by that ticket and let us know!

That's why your avatar is sleeping! To check yourself out of the inn, go to Social > Tavern > Check out of inn.

        p "Mighty Habiticans," she says, "My citizens and I owe you the deepest thanks, and the deepest apologies. In an effort to protect our Steppes from turmoil, we began to secretly banish all of our stress into the icy mountains. We had no idea that it would build up over generations into the Stressbeast that you saw! When it broke loose, it trapped all of us in the mountains in its stead and went on a rampage against our beloved animals." Her sad gaze follows the falling snow. "We put everyone at risk with our foolishness. Rest assured that in the future, we will come to you with our problems before our problems come to you."

        p The first thing we hear are the footsteps, slower and more thundering than the stampede. One by one, Habiticans look outside their doors, and words fail us.
        p We've all seen Stressbeasts before, of course - tiny vicious creatures that attack during difficult times. But this? This towers taller than the buildings, with paws that could crush a dragon with ease. Frost swings from its stinking fur, and as it roars, the icy blast rips the roofs off our houses. A monster of this magnitude has never been mentioned outside of distant legend.
        p "Beware, Habiticans!" SabreCat cries. "Barricade yourselves indoors - this is the Abominable Stressbeast itself!"
        p "That thing must be made of centuries of stress!" Kiwibot says, locking the Tavern door tightly and shuttering the windows.
        p "The Stoïkalm Steppes," Lemoness says, face grim. "All this time, we thought they were placid and untroubled, but they must have been secretly hiding their stress somewhere. Over generations, it grew into this, and now it's broken free and attacked them - and us!"
        p There's only one way to drive away a Stressbeast, Abominable or otherwise, and that's to attack it with completed Dailies and To-Dos! Let's all band together and fight off this fearsome foe - but be sure not to slack on your tasks, or our undone Dailies may enrage it so much that it lashes out...

        p A thundering herd of mammoths charges past, sabertooths roar, and dinosaurs both feathery and scaly slither by at top speed. Habiticans stare open-mouthed, but before anyone can react, the stampede has swept through Habit City and is gone into the distance, leaving only pawprints in the snow, the howling wind, and some trampled New Year's cards.
        p Habiticans are advised to keep calm and not give in to stress during this confusing and difficult time. We've sent SabreCat after the frightened animals from the Stoïkalm Steppes, and he is working to calm them down so that we can bring them back to the safety of the Stables. We hope to have an explanation for this strangeness soon. In the meantime, keep all of your own pets and mounts indoors.

        p If you've already contributed, you've been given the gems that you're owed according to the new system. (For example, if you are a tier 3 contributor, you received 6 gems in the past and would receive 9 gems under the new system, so you've been awarded 3 gems to account for the difference.)

We've also written a <a href='http://blog.habitrpg.com/post/98367930371/update-diagnosing-server-problems' target='_blank'>blog post</a>. We'll keep you updated with new developments as we strive to solve this problem.

We've awoken something horrifying from the crevasse: **the Dread Drag'on of Dilatory!** Screaming Habiticans fled in all directions when it reared out of the sea, its terrifyingly long neck extending hundreds of feet out of the water as it shattered windows with its searing roar.
        p "This must be what dragged Dilatory down!" yells Lemoness. "It wasn't the weight of the neglected tasks - the Dark Red Dailies just attracted its attention!"
        p "It's surging with magical energy!" @Baconsaur cries. "To have lived this long, it must be able to heal itself! How can we defeat it?"
        p Why, the same way we defeat all beasts - with productivity! Quickly, Habitica, band together and strike through your tasks, and all of us will battle this monster together. (There's no need to abandon previous quests -  we believe in your ability to double-strike!) It won't attack us individually, but the more Dailies we skip, the closer we get to triggering its Neglect Strike - and I don't like the way it's eyeing the Tavern....

It was a prosperous place, but as the wealth of the city grew, the inHabitants grew lazy and procrastinated on their Dailies and To-Dos... until the combined weight of their dark red tasks triggered a massive earthquake that sunk the city. Legends say that all of the inHabitants were transformed into sea creatures.
        p The location of this city was lost to time... until now!
        h3 Limited Edition Outfits!
        p What's the fun of an underwater city if you can't explore it? Luckily, from now until July 31st, special Limited Edition Outfits are available for gold in the Rewards store! Spellcasters can transform themselves into <strong>Emerald Mermages</strong> and <strong>Reef Seahealers</strong> to swim among the ruins, while fighters may prefer to dress as <strong>Roguish Pirates</strong> and <strong>Daring Swashbucklers</strong>, riding above the city on magnificent ships. Work hard, and you can join them!
        h3 NPC Dress-up
        p The NPCs got so excited about the discovery of Dilatory that they've moved over there for the summer! Daniel the Innkeeper has opened a beachside tavern, and Alex is also selling by the shore! Meanwhile, Justin the Guide is giving tours aboard boats, Ian is dispensing quest wisdom from the deep ocean, Matt has opened stables for aquatic pets, and I am swimming about keeping everyone informed!
        h3 But what caused the Earthquake?
        p Only one piece of the mystery remains unsolved - what caused the second earthquake that unearthed the ancient Dailies? After all, the earthquake that destroyed Dilatory was caused by a build up of undone Dailies and To-Dos, wasn't it?
        p But *we've* all been doing our tasks...

        h3 Summer Mystery Update
        p It's been a while since we've seen Lemoness around - she's been a bit scarce since she started trying to decipher those ancient Dailies. We just stopped by her hut to check on her and found her..... missing?
        br
        p It looked like she'd taken her armor-enchanting crochet hook, but little else. There was a single scrawled note on the table: "I think I've translated it!!!! If I'm right, this is going to be QUITE the summer. Verifying claims - be back soon!!!"
        br
        p The only other thing on the table was an ancient map... with the corner ripped off.

        h3 Earthquake Update
        p Remember the strange earthquake we had recently? Well, this probably isn't related in any way, but Habiticans have recently noticed some mysterious black Dailies strewn along the beaches. Lemoness happily reports that they are scrawled upon with an ancient language, and that she is hard at work deciphering the script. More news as this develops!

Well, if Lemoness says so, it must be true! Seems like it was just a false alarm.

        p Also, just a reminder - January 31st is the final day of the Winter Wonderland event, so it's your last day to get the Limited Edition Winter Hair Colors, the Winter Outfits, the snowballs, and the Trapper Santa and Find the Cub quest scrolls. Remember that mid-progress Trapper Santa and Find the Cub quests will not abort, nor will you lose your scrolls - they will simply be removed from Alexander's marketplace. We hope that you've had a wonderful winter!

And if you're not already, be sure to follow our updates on <a href="http://habitrpg.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> (there are some fun member highlights recently).
