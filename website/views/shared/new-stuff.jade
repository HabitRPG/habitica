It will still be available for free to users of Level 100 and above. If you've used the Orb of Rebirth in the past and would like your Equipment restored, let us know in the <a href='/#/options/groups/guilds/a29da26b-37de-4a71-b0c6-48e72a900dac'>Report a Bug Guild</a> and we'll fix things up for you!

        p We've made this change in response to feedback suggesting Rebirth could be improved. Previously, Rebirth made the Rewards list too long and re-earning the gold to recover all the equipment was daunting, particularly when it came to seasonal Grand Gala gear. We hope this modification works to alleviate these concerns and that Rebirth is a feature that continues to motivate everyone.
        br

        p This Saturday, we will be performing important maintenance on Habitica to build out the groundwork for some exciting upcoming features! We'll be doing everything we can to make this as smooth as possible, but unfortunately, there will be significant downtime for much of the day.
        br
        p.strong We expect that on Saturday, May 21st, Habitica will be unavailable between <a href='http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?pl=1&lid=5368361,100&h=5368361' target='_blank'>1 PM and 10 PM Pacific Time (8 pm - 5 am UTC)</a>.
        ul
          li Don't worry, <strong>you will NOT lose any streaks or take any damage during this weekend, not even from Bosses!</strong> This maintenance will not harm your accounts.
          li If you will need to see your task list on Saturday, <strong>we recommend taking a screenshot of your tasks before the maintenance begins</strong> so that you can use them as a reference during downtime.
          li At the end of the maintenance, to thank people for their patience, <strong>everyone will receive a rare Veteran pet!</strong>
          li This maintenance should not result in any major visible differences to the site; it's all behind-the-scenes work. However, <strong>at the end of it, we will release new updates to the mobile apps, which will be required in order for the apps to work properly with the new changes!</strong> Be sure to download those updates on Saturday as soon as they are released.
          li For more information, please <strong>check out our detailed <a href='/static/maintenance-info'>info page</a> about the maintenance!</strong> And if you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to Leslie (<a href='mailto:leslie@habitica.com' target='_blank'>leslie@habitica.com</a>), and she will be happy to help you.
        p We understand that it's very frustrating to have Habitica unavailable for such a long part of the day. Rest assured that we'll be doing everything we can to make the maintenance go as quickly as possible, but with over a million Habitican accounts to migrate, this is a hefty task! During the maintenance on Saturday we will be posting regular status reports on our <a href='https://twitter.com/habitica' target='_blank'>Twitter account</a>, so you can follow us for the most accurate updates.

        p As Habiticans cuddle the magical fuzzy bees, the April Fool’s eyes light up. “Oho, I’ve had a thought! Why don’t you all keep some of these Magical Bee Pets and Mounts? It’s a gift that perfectly symbolizes the balance between hard work and sweet rewards, if I’m going to get all boring and allegorical on you.” He winks. “Besides, they don’t have stingers! Fool’s honor.”

        br
        p As the Mistiflying clock tower strikes midnight, the April Fool leaps onto the stage to give a speech.
        br
        p “Friends! Enemies! Tolerant acquaintances! Lend me your ears.” The crowd chuckles as animal ears sprout from their heads, and they pose with their new accessories.

        p “As you know,” the Fool continues, “my confusing illusions usually only last a single day. But I’m pleased to announce that I’ve discovered a shortcut that will guarantee us non-stop fun, without having to deal with the pesky weight of our responsibilities. Charming Habiticans, meet my magical new friend... the Be-Wilder!”
        br
        p Lemoness pales suddenly, dropping her hors d'oeuvres. “Wait! Don’t trust--”
        br
        p But suddenly mists are pouring into the room, glittering and thick, and they swirl around the April Fool, coalescing into cloudy feathers and a stretching neck. The crowd is speechless as an monstrous bird unfolds before them, its wings shimmering with illusions. It lets out a horrible screeching laugh.
        br
        p “Oh, it has been ages since a Habitican has been foolish enough to summon me! How wonderful it feels, to have a tangible form at last.”
        br
        p Buzzing in terror, the magic bees of Mistiflying flee the floating city, which sags from the sky. One by one, the brilliant spring flowers wither up and wisp away.
        br
        p “My dearest friends, why so alarmed?” crows the Be-Wilder, beating its wings. “There’s no need to toil for your rewards any more. I’ll just give you all the things that you desire!”
        br
        p A rain of coins pours from the sky, hammering into the ground with brutal force, and the crowd screams and flees for cover. “Is this a joke?” Baconsaur shouts, as the gold smashes through windows and shatters roof shingles.
        br
        p PainterProphet ducks as lightning bolt crackle overhead, and fog blots out the sun. “No! This time, I don’t think it is!”
        br
        p Quickly, Habiticans, don’t let this World Boss distract us from our goals! Stay focused on the tasks that you need to complete so we can rescue Mistiflying -- and hopefully, ourselves.

        p Mistiflying is a flower-filled city that drifts in the clouds above Habitica, manufacturing custom rewards and raining them down on deserving Habiticans. It’s brimming with friendly, magical bees that work hard to keep the blossoms healthy and the city floating, and there’s a festive humming in the air. Looks like we’ll get a chance for plenty of parties this month! We’ve even received a visit from Mistiflying’s somewhat erratic ruler: the April Fool, a masterful rogue with a penchant for fun and an interest in illusions.

        p The April Fool swishes his cape over his shoulders, striding through the mists into Habit City. “Lemoness! Redphoenix! SabreCat! My dearest and most delightful friends!” He sweeps out his arms in a striking pose, and several firework displays go off behind him. “Oho, look at your faces! It’s like you aren’t even happy to see me.”
        br
        p Lemoness does, in fact, seem less than thrilled. “It’s just… the last time you were here, I was kidnapped by a mutant flower uprising."
        br
        p “Really! Did I cause that?”
        br
        p Redphoenix smolders. “Two years ago, you turned me into an eggplant.”
        br
        p “An honest misunderstanding, I am sure. But it did only last a single day!”
        The April Fool links his arm with SabreCat and gives the tracker a winning smile. “Which reminds me – Sabe, I can crash in your guest cottage again this month, right? No hard feelings about the Mammoth Ballet incident?”
        br
        p SabreCat lets out a strangled growl, and Lemoness hastily pulls the April Fool out of claw range.
        br
        p “You’re here for a whole month?” Redphoenix says. "What, did Lady Glaciate banish you from the Stoïkalm Steppes again?"
        br
        p The April Fool seems affronted at the suggestion. "Rumors, hearsay, and probably lies! Still, Habit City may temporarily be a more hospitable place to hover over. For entirely unrelated reasons, you understand."
        br
        p Lemoness rubs her temples.“Even so. It's not that we don’t... appreciate your yearly creativity, but we’re in the middle of the Spring Fling festivities. It’s a very busy time!!”
        br
        p He taps her affectionately on the nose. “Nothing to fear, my citrusy dear! Believe me, you won’t even notice I’m here.”

It will take a unicorn to purify the waters of Conquest Creek, but that means hiking through the frigid peaks of the Meandering Mountains. Can you prove to the Unicorn Queen that your cause is worthy? If so, you'll earn some unicorn eggs!

        p Burnout has been defeated! All Habiticans have received rewards, including a phoenix pet and mount, assorted candies, and the Savior of the Flourishing Fields achievement. Well done! Here's how it happened:
        br
        p With a great, soft sigh, Burnout slowly releases the ardent energy that was fueling its fire. As the monster curls quietly into ashes, its stolen energy shimmers through the air, rejuvenating the Exhaust Spirits and returning them to their true forms.
        br
        p Ian, Daniel, and the Seasonal Sorceress cheer as Habiticans rush to greet them, and all the missing citizens of the Flourishing Fields embrace their friends and families. The final Exhaust Spirit transforms into the Joyful Reaper herself!
        br
        p "Look!" whispers @Baconsaur, as the ashes begin to glitter. Slowly, they resolve into hundreds of shining phoenixes!
        br
        p One of glowing birds alights on the Joyful Reaper's skeletal arm, and she grins at it. "It has been a long time since I've had the exquisite privilege to behold a phoenix in the Flourishing Fields," she says. "Although given recent occurrences, I must say, this is highly thematically appropriate!"
        br
        p Her tone sobers, although (naturally) her grin remains. "We're known for being hard-working here, but we are also known for our feasts and festivities. Rather ironic, I suppose, that as we strove to plan a spectacular party, we refused to permit ourselves any time for fun. We certainly won't make the same mistake twice!"
        br
        p She claps her hands. "Now - let's celebrate!"

        p It is well past midnight, still and stiflingly hot, when Redphoenix and scout captain Kiwibot abruptly burst through the city gates. "We need to evacuate all the wooden buildings!" Redphoenix shouts. "Hurry!"
        br
        p Kiwibot grips the wall as she catches her breath."It's draining people and turning them into Exhaust Spirits! That's why everything was delayed. That's where the missing people have gone. It's been stealing their energy!"

        br
        p It rises from the earth in a billowing, twisting mass, and the air chokes with the scent of smoke and sulphur. Flames lick across the molten ground and contort into limbs, writhing to horrific heights. Smoldering eyes snap open, and the creature lets out a deep and crackling cackle.

        hr
        p Quickly, Habiticans, we have to save the Flourishing Fields from incineration! All of us will battle this World Boss together by completing tasks, but it won't attack us individually. However, the more Dailies we skip, the closer we get to triggering its fearsome Exhaust Strike, which will target our NPCs!

        p We are pleased to announce that the final day of the Summer Splash Festival, July 31st, will be the inaugural Habitica Naming Day! On this day, HabitRPG will officially become Habitica. Our old name was unfortunately very confusing to people ("HabitZPR? HabitGRG?"), so we've decided to name our app and website after the land of Habitica, where all these adventures take place.

          li The HabitRPG chest logo will change to the new Habitica logo.
          li Our affiliated sites, such as the Wiki, Trello, Twitter, etc. will use the new Habitica name.
          li We don't anticipate any issues with third-party tools, but we will be actively working with developers to help them make any necessary updates. You can help us by reporting broken third-party tools at <a href='https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg/issues/2760' target='_blank'>Help -&gt; Report a Bug</a>.

        p Habitica is the land where HabitRPG takes place - a land where players ride dragons and slay Dailies. Plus, it's now the name of the mobile app. Soon, it will also be the name of the site!
        br
        p The decision to switch from HabitRPG to Habitica is a big one, and we've been talking it over for a long time. We've gotten feedback since the beginning that it was confusing, especially for the many people who aren't familiar with the acronym. ("HabitPGR? HabitRZG? What was your name again?") We feel that "Habitica" keeps the fantasy flair without the confusing abbreviation, so it's the best of both realms.
        br
        p So far, habitica.com redirects to habitrpg.com, and it's the name of the native mobile apps. Look forward to an upcoming announcement of the switchover date, when we will be ringing in the name change with our inaugural Habitica Day celebration!

        p Now even when you Rest in the Inn, your Dailies will refresh each day. <strong>Important note: your Dailies still do NOT hurt you while you're in the Inn.</strong> We wouldn't do that to you!
        br
        p It used to be that the Resting in the Inn froze all your Dailies so that they wouldn't refresh the next day - even for important Dailies like "take medicine" or "feed pets." This was very frustrating to a lot of users who relied on these features, even during periods of time when they needed to rest in the Inn for finals, illness, vacation, etc.
        br
        p Now if you're in a situation, for example finals period, where you don't have the time or energy to do most of your Dailies, you can still complete some of them every day while Resting in the Inn. It's much more flexible and convenient!
        br
        p If you're in a quest, you still won't deal damage/collect items until you check out of the Inn, and your Dailies will not damage your party members, but you can still be injured by a Boss if your Party mates skip their own Dailies. You also still do not gain Mana overnight until you check out of the Inn. If you have any questions about how Resting in the Inn works, be sure to ask in the <a href='https://habitrpg.com/#/options/groups/guilds/5481ccf3-5d2d-48a9-a871-70a7380cee5a' target='_blank'>Newbies Guild!</a>

  h2 5/01/2015 - Skills Rebalancing
    hr
    tr
      td
        p After over a year's worth of complaints on Trello and countless bug reports on Github, and after almost five months of dedicated debating, coding, and testing, we have finally rolled out an overhaul of the skills and mana system. Thank you so much to everyone who contributed opinions, time, and effort! Here's what happened:
    tr
      td
        h3 HABITS DAMAGE BOSSES
        p Now it's even easier to damage a Boss without skills! It was definitely high time that HabitRPG counted Habits towards battles. We were not living up to our name.
    tr
      td
        h3 MANA DIRECTLY LINKED TO PROGRESS
        p Mana was pretty broken: you gained it overnight no matter what you'd done the day before, and it was only linked to To-Dos. This meant that using skills was pretty detached from how well you were doing in your real life, which defeated the purpose of the game!
        p Now you can gain Mana from Dailies and positive Habits as well as To-Dos! You still gain Mana overnight, but how much you gain depends on how many of your Dailies you did.
        p You can also lose Mana by hitting negative Habits. Yikes! Better not indulge...
    tr
      td
        h3 SKILLS STRENGTHENED AND WEAKENED
        p Some notoriously overpowered skills have been weakened, like Backstab (which often granted over 1000GP per cast), Burst of Flames (which allowed you to 1-hit KO most bosses regardless of how much or how little you'd done that day), and Valorous Presence (which caused the notorious "I checked off one Daily and gained 997 levels" bug reports).
        p Some painfully UNDERpowered skills have been strengthened, such as Tools of the Trade and Searing Brightness. We think you'll like these much better now!
        p For a full description of what changed, <a href='http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:LadyAlys/Skills_Rebalancing_and_Other_Changes' target='_blank'>check out this blog post</a>.
    tr
      td
        h3 GIVING FEEDBACK
        p We understand that these changes may be disruptive to some of you. We're sorry! We hope that with time, you will find them to be a drastic improvement. We will be waiting two weeks (so that everyone can get used to the new system), and then on May 15th will open up a new Trello card for comments and feedback.
        p For those of you who want to reallocate stats now that you have the new system, please post your User ID in this <a href='https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg/issues/5082' target='_blank'>Github ticket</a>. (Your UUID is found under Settings > API; do NOT post your API Token.) That ticket is also being used to debate a possibility to make it so that reallocating stats does not cost gems. If that's a feature you would like (or would hate), definitely drop by that ticket and let us know!

We got a surge of new users from Imgur who absolutely flattened the servers by registering all at once, and it proved very difficult to start up again. You can read the technical details <a href="https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg/issues/4737" target="_blank">in this Github ticket</a>. We're sorry about all of the frustration!
        br
        p At about midnight PST we checked all active users into the inn, "freezing" their accounts so that their incomplete Dailies would not hurt them, in hopes that this would prevent most of the undeserved deaths due to server troubles. That's why your avatar is sleeping! To check yourself out of the inn, go to Social > Tavern > Check out of inn.
        br
        p If you died before we could check you into the Inn, you can restore your streaks under task edit, and all other stats under Settings > Site > Fix Character Values. You should be able to buy back all missing items under Rewards. If you cannot, please post in Social > Tavern and a moderator will help you!

        p Thank you so much to all of our intrepid users who answered questions on social media and in the chat rooms, and to everyone who sent us kind messages while we were scrambling to save the site. You guys are incredible, and we feel constantly lucky to have such a caring and positive community.

        p We've all seen Stressbeasts before, of course - tiny vicious creatures that attack during difficult times. But this? This towers taller than the buildings, with paws that could crush a dragon with ease. Frost swings from its stinking fur, and as it roars, the icy blast rips the roofs off our houses. A monster of this magnitude has never been mentioned outside of distant legend.

        p "That thing must be made of centuries of stress!" Kiwibot says, locking the Tavern door tightly and shuttering the windows.
        p "The Stoïkalm Steppes," Lemoness says, face grim. "All this time, we thought they were placid and untroubled, but they must have been secretly hiding their stress somewhere. Over generations, it grew into this, and now it's broken free and attacked them - and us!"
        p There's only one way to drive away a Stressbeast, Abominable or otherwise, and that's to attack it with completed Dailies and To-Dos! Let's all band together and fight off this fearsome foe - but be sure not to slack on your tasks, or our undone Dailies may enrage it so much that it lashes out...

        h3 Winter Plot-Line Continues
        p After a fun-filled New Year's Eve, Habiticans wake to a rumbling that shakes them out of their Absurd Party Hats. Running to their windows reveals.... a stampede?
        p A thundering herd of mammoths charges past, sabertooths roar, and dinosaurs both feathery and scaly slither by at top speed. Habiticans stare open-mouthed, but before anyone can react, the stampede has swept through Habit City and is gone into the distance, leaving only pawprints in the snow, the howling wind, and some trampled New Year's cards.
        p Habiticans are advised to keep calm and not give in to stress during this confusing and difficult time. We've sent SabreCat after the frightened animals from the Stoïkalm Steppes, and he is working to calm them down so that we can bring them back to the safety of the Stables. We hope to have an explanation for this strangeness soon. In the meantime, keep all of your own pets and mounts indoors.

        p If you've already contributed, you've been given the gems that you're owed according to the new system. (For example, if you are a tier 3 contributor, you received 6 gems in the past and would receive 9 gems under the new system, so you've been awarded 3 gems to account for the difference.)
        p Enjoy!

This is because we've received many requests for these Limited Edition skins from more recent players who were unable to purchase those skins. As a compromise, we have decided to Retire the Spooky Skin Set and release some similar but unique skins as part of the Supernatural Skin Set. That way, anyone who wants their avatar to be a pumpkin can have their way, but the original owners of the skin sets still have the unique items that they were promised.

        p The Dread Drag'on's Rage Bar has filled, and it has unleashed its Neglect Strike, leading to a new look for the Tavern! As a reminder, the Drag'on's rage will NEVER hurt any users or interfere with their ability to be productive, so the chat and inn are still functional. Even so... poor Daniel!
        p All users are automatically damaging the Drag'on with their tasks. There is nothing bad that can happen to you or your account by being in this fight!

        p We've received a lot of feedback due to the weekend's confusion, and it seems that awarding GP and XP for defeating the world boss significantly unbalanced the game for newer players. Based on your feedback, XP and GP will no longer be awarded. Instead, players will receive an assortment of food! The Mantis Shrimps will still be awarded.
        p If you were looking forward to receiving the 900XP and 90 GP upon completion of the battle, feel free to award it to yourself using Settings > Site > Fix Character Values when the battle is done!
        p Thank you for bearing with us through the confusion. We love you guys.

        p The Drag’on is now back in the battle (<a href='http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/The_Dread_Drag'on_of_Dilatory' target='_blank'>read about how to fight it here</a>), and the Mantis Shrimp pet/mount were removed until it is defeated for good. We are so sorry about the confusion!
        br
        p If you don’t want the 900 XP and 90 Gold, you can delete it using Settings > Site >Fix Character Values. You can also keep it as an apology from the devs for all the confusion! Do whatever is most motivating for you :) It will be granted again when the Drag'on is truly vanquished.
        br
        p The Drag’on also caused some glitches with party boss damage, but they should be repaired now.

        p We should have heeded the warnings.
        p Dark shining eyes. Ancient scales. Massive jaws, and flashing teeth. We've awoken something horrifying from the crevasse: **the Dread Drag'on of Dilatory!** Screaming Habiticans fled in all directions when it reared out of the sea, its terrifyingly long neck extending hundreds of feet out of the water as it shattered windows with its searing roar.
        p "This must be what dragged Dilatory down!" yells Lemoness. "It wasn't the weight of the neglected tasks - the Dark Red Dailies just attracted its attention!"
        p "It's surging with magical energy!" @Baconsaur cries. "To have lived this long, it must be able to heal itself! How can we defeat it?"
        p Why, the same way we defeat all beasts - with productivity! Quickly, Habitica, band together and strike through your tasks, and all of us will battle this monster together. (There's no need to abandon previous quests -  we believe in your ability to double-strike!) It won't attack us individually, but the more Dailies we skip, the closer we get to triggering its Neglect Strike - and I don't like the way it's eyeing the Tavern....

        p Wait - found what?
        h3 Summer Splash Event: The Lost City Of Dilatory!
        p Dilatory was a lovely island city of ancient Habitica. It was a prosperous place, but as the wealth of the city grew, the inHabitants grew lazy and procrastinated on their Dailies and To-Dos... until the combined weight of their dark red tasks triggered a massive earthquake that sunk the city. Legends say that all of the inHabitants were transformed into sea creatures.
        p The location of this city was lost to time... until now!
        h3 Limited Edition Outfits!
        p What's the fun of an underwater city if you can't explore it? Luckily, from now until July 31st, special Limited Edition Outfits are available for gold in the Rewards store! Spellcasters can transform themselves into <strong>Emerald Mermages</strong> and <strong>Reef Seahealers</strong> to swim among the ruins, while fighters may prefer to dress as <strong>Roguish Pirates</strong> and <strong>Daring Swashbucklers</strong>, riding above the city on magnificent ships. Work hard, and you can join them!
        h3 NPC Dress-up
        p The NPCs got so excited about the discovery of Dilatory that they've moved over there for the summer! Daniel the Innkeeper has opened a beachside tavern, and Alex is also selling by the shore! Meanwhile, Justin the Guide is giving tours aboard boats, Ian is dispensing quest wisdom from the deep ocean, Matt has opened stables for aquatic pets, and I am swimming about keeping everyone informed!
        h3 But what caused the Earthquake?
        p Only one piece of the mystery remains unsolved - what caused the second earthquake that unearthed the ancient Dailies? After all, the earthquake that destroyed Dilatory was caused by a build up of undone Dailies and To-Dos, wasn't it?

Additionally, after you have defeated a Pet Quest Boss two times, those eggs will be gem-purchasable in the market like all other eggs, so that your party doesn't have to replay the same quest over and over :)

At the tavern you hear @DanielTheBard struming dark tales on his lute, and @Baconsaur peering into a mug, grumbling about her mounts swallowed in the shadows. They speak of the same thing: <strong>Vice</strong>, a dark an terrible foe. This new boss arc is a 3-part quest that requires level 30 to begin.

        Hello my Habiteers! I have some amazing news to share with you, it's huge!
         Has Habit ever crashed for you? (Joke). Well we <u><a target='_blank' href="http://habitrpg.tumblr.com/post/59104876969/website-issues-what-were-doing">re-wrote the website</a></u> from the ground up
         to conquor those critical bugs once and for all (more from Tyler in a bit). If you haven't seen me for a while (due to a bug in the old site), be sure to catch up with me on the right side of the screen for any missed news. Importantly:
         <a target='_blank' href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ocdevel.habitrpg'>Android</a> & <a target='_blank' href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/habitrpg/id689569235?mt=8'>iOS</a> Apps are out!</u>
    tr
      td.
        They're open source, so help us make them awesome. As for the rewrite: not all features are yet ported, but don't worry - you're still getting drops and streak-bonuses in the background, even if you can't see them yet.
         We'll be working hard to bring in all the missing features. And if you're not already, be sure to follow our updates on <a href="http://habitrpg.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> (there are some fun member highlights recently). One more thing: if you are a Veteran of the old site, I have granted you a Veteran Wolf! Check your inventory :)
    tr
      td.
        JavaScript developers! To me! We must finish vanquishing the old site, as not all features have been ported.
         We rewrote Habit on <a target='_blank' href='http://angularjs.org/'>AngularJS</a> + <a target='_blank' href='http://expressjs.com/'>Express</a>.
         We desparately need your help porting <a href='http://goo.gl/jYWTwl' target='_blank'>the rest of the features</a>, and polishing off the bugs. <a target='_blank' href='http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Contributing_to_HabitRPG'>Read this guide</a> to getting started.
