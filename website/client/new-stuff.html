In the spirit of the season, Habiticans who dress up in real-life versions of their avatar's armor (or in any Habitica costume) will receive a special badge. (No, just wearing a colored shirt doesn't count. Where's the fun in that?)</p><br/><p>The Community Costume Challenge will start on October 1st, but we're announcing it early so that people have time to get their costumes together.</p><br/><p>Instructions on how to participate in the CCC will be posted when the Challenge is live. We can't wait to see your costumes!</p><p class="small muted">by Lemoness</p></td></tr></h2><hr/><a href="/static/old-news" target="_blank">Read older news</a>
