    <h3 id="collection-of-information">1. Collection of Information</h3>
    <p>We and our third-party service providers and business partners may collect information from you directly and automatically when you visit the Services and from third parties. Some of this information may be considered “personal information” or “personal data” under various applicable laws. We consider information that identifies you as a specific, identified individual (such as your name, phone number, and e-mail address) to be personal information. We will also treat additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as “personal information” or “personal data” where required by applicable law.</p>
    <p>We may take your personal information and de-identify or pseudonymize it to make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals and/or by hashing the information or otherwise removing characteristics that make the information personally identifiable directly to you. We maintain and use de-identified or pseudonymized data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements. We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized information as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law.</p>
      <h4 id="information-you-provide-directly">1.1 Information You Provide Directly</h4>
      <p>We may ask you to provide certain personal information when you interact with the Services. This information may include contact information (such as your name and email), account information (such as your email - and if you choose to log in through Google or Apple, the associated user ID and email address), transaction information (such as your billing address and mailing address), or user content you choose to upload (such as photos and task lists). Note that all payments are handled by our third-party payment providers who may collect relevant information in order to complete your transaction (such as your payment card, billing address, and phone number) and are subject to its privacy policy, as provided at the time of such collection.</p>
      <p>We may also ask you to provide the contact information of another individual, such as when you invite another user to the Services. When you provide us with an individual’s contact information in this context, we will only use this information for the specific reason for which it was provided.</p>
      <h4 id="information-we-collect-automatically">1.2 Information We Collect Automatically</h4>
      <p>We and third-party companies and business partners may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect certain information whenever you visit our Services or otherwise interact with us or our content (<strong>“Usage Information”</strong>). Usage Information may include the hardware model, browser, and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Service you are visiting, all of the areas within the Services that you visit, your time zone, non-precise location information, and mobile network (if applicable), among other information. In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (<strong>“Device Identifier”</strong>) for any computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access our Services. In some cases, we may directly collect location information through your device. You may be able to turn off the collection of location information through the settings on your device. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if HabitRPG associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, HabitRPG treats it as personal information.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Web Tags</em>: Small graphic images or other web programming code called web tags (also known as “pixel tags,” “1x1 GIFs,” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our email messages sent by our third-party service providers on our behalf. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for several purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many emails that were sent were opened, or to count how many particular links were actually viewed.</li>
        <li><em>Embedded Scripts</em>: An embedded script is a programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our server or a third-party service.</li>
        <li><em>Session Events</em>: HabitRPG may engage third party service providers to analyze your session events with user interfaces, including what pages you visit on the Service, how long you visit those pages, the links you click, and your path through the Service for website analytics purposes, solely for our internal business purposes, and to improve our Services.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="location-data">1.3 Location Data</h4>
      <p>We do not collect your precise location. However, please note that we may still be able to collect or infer your approximate location through other information we collect, such as IP address. In addition, some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the non-precise physical location of the device used to access our Services.</p>
      <h4 id="information-from-third-parties">1.4 Information from Third Parties</h4>
      <p>We may receive information about you from third parties. You may have the opportunity to log in through or otherwise connect your Apple and Google accounts. Additionally, when you interact with us through social media, you will be choosing to share information about your interactions with HabitRPG with that social media service.</p>
      <p>The following chart sets out by category the personal data collected (<strong>“Category”</strong>), the purposes for which the information is collected (<strong>“A. Purposes”</strong>), the categories of third parties to whom the information may be disclosed for a business purpose (<strong>“B. Disclosed To”</strong>), and the categories of third parties to whom the information may be sold for monetary value or other valuable consideration or shared for cross-context behavioral advertising/targeted marketing (<strong>“C. Sold/Shared To”</strong>).</p>
