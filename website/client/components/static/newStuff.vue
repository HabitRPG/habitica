        h3 Winter Class Outfits
        p From now until January 31st, limited edition outfits are available in the Rewards column. Depending on your class, you can be a Confetti Mage, a Mistletoe Healer, a Reindeer Rogue, or a Gift-Wrapped Warrior! You'd better get productive to earn enough gold before they disappear. Good luck!
