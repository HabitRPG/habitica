New landing page for Habitica

## Scrolling animations
I’ve included a wireframe that shows the interactions I’m looking for. There are also comments in the HTML file.

Thinking of using [ScrollMagic](http://janpaepke.github.io/ScrollMagic/) but if there’s anything anyone else knows and can implement quickly, I’m all ears!

@lefnire suggests [Skrollr](https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr), so that’s another option!
