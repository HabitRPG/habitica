# Sprites

The individual sprites and css that help map them to spritesheets live here.

## Compiling spritesheets
Because of some wonkiness with Heroku, the spritesheet compilation is not part of the production build process and must be done manually when new images are added by running:

``` bash
npm run sprites
```
