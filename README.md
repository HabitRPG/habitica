===============

[HabitRPG](https://habitrpg.com) is an open source habit building program which treats your life like a Role Playing Game. Level up as you succeed, lose HP as you fail, earn money to buy weapons and armor.

We need more programmers! Your assistance will be greatly appreciated.

For an introduction to the technologies used and how the software is organised, refer to [Contributing to HabitRPG](http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Contributing_to_HabitRPG#Coders_.28Web_.26_Mobile.29) - "Coders (Web & Mobile)" section.

To set up a local install of HabitRPG for development and testing, see [Setting up HabitRPG locally](http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Setting_up_HabitRPG_locally), which contains instructions for Windows, *nix / Mac OS, and Vagrant.

Then read [Guidance for Blacksmiths](http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Guidance_for_Blacksmiths) for additional instructions and useful tips.
