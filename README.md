Usage :
JS Applications
Suitable for applications that have their own bundler and send the JS bundle directly to a client (without publishing it to npm). Think of a user-facing app or website, like an email client, a CRM, a landing page or a blog with interactive elements, using React/Vue/cofee js  or node JS.


Big Libraries :
JS libraries > 10 KB in size.
This preset includes headless Chrome, and will measure your lib’s execution time. You likely don’t need this overhead for a small 2 KB lib, but for larger ones the execution time is a more accurate and understandable metric that the size in bytes. Library like React is a good example for this preset.
