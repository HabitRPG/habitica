HabitRPG [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HabitRPG/habitrpg.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/HabitRPG/habitrpg) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/HabitRPG/habitrpg.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/HabitRPG/habitrpg)
===============

[HabitRPG](https://habitrpg.com) is an open source habit building program which treats your life like a Role Playing Game. Level up as you succeed, lose HP as you fail, earn money to buy weapons and armor.

Built using [Angular](http://angularjs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/), [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/).

# Set up HabitRPG locally

**Windows** users should skip this section and read the one below with Windows-specific steps.

Before starting make sure to have [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [NodeJS and npm](http://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) installed and set up.

1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) on your computer.
1. Checkout the `develop` branch where all the development happens:
`git checkout -t origin/develop`
1. Install **grunt-cli** npm package globally (on some systems you may need to add `sudo` in front of the command below):
`npm install -g grunt-cli bower`
1. Install our dependencies: `npm install`
1. Create a config file from the example one:
`cp config.json.example config.json`
1. Ensure that Mongo is running and seed the database with initial settings by running:
`node src/seed.js`.

##  Windows Environment Install

1. Set up MongoDB.  Steps:
  1.  Download the [latest production release of MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
  1.  Extract the zip file to the desired application directory. Example: `c:\apps\mongodb-win32-x86_64-2.4.6`
  1.  Rename the folder from `mongodb-win32-x86_64-2.4.6` to `mongodb`
  1.  Create a `data\db` directory under the application directory. Example: `c:\apps\mongodb\data\db`
  1.  Start up MongoDB using the following command: `c:\apps\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --dbpath c:\apps\mongodb\data`

  If MongoDB starts up successfully, you should see the following at the end of the logs:

  ```
  Sun Sep 01 18:10:21.233 [initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017
  Sun Sep 01 18:10:21.233 [websvr] admin web console waiting for connections on port 28017
  ```

1. [Install Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) (includes npm).
1. [Install Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git).
1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) on your computer.
1. Checkout the `develop` branch where all the development happens:
`git checkout -t origin/develop`
1. Install our dependencies: `npm install`.

    You might receive the following error during the `npm install` command:

    ```
    habitrpg@0.0.0-152 postinstall C:\...\habitrpg
    ./node_modules/bower/bin/bower install -f
    '.' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
    operable program or batch file.
    npm ERR! weird error 1
    npm ERR! not ok code 0
    ```
    Ignore this error and proceed with the following:

1. Install **grunt-cli** and **bower** npm packages globally:
`npm install -g grunt-cli bower`
1. Install the **bower** packages:
`bower install -f`
1. Create a config file from the example one:
`copy config.json.example config.json`
1. Ensure that Mongo is running and seed the database with initial settings by r
unning:
`node src\seed.js`.

# Run HabitRPG

HabitRPG uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) as its build tool.

`grunt run:dev` compiles the **Stylus** files and start a web server.

It uses [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) and [grunt-contrib-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) to automatically restart the server and re-compile the files when a change is detected.

**Open a browser to URL http://localhost:3000 to test the application!**

# Technologies discussion

1. Angular, Express, Mongoose. Awesome, tried technologies. Read up on them.
1. Stylus, Jade - big debate.
  1. Jade. We need a server-side templating language so we can inject variables (`res.locals` from Express). Jade is great
     because the "significant whitespace" paradigm protects you from HTML errors such as missing or mal-matched close tags,
     which has been a pretty common error from multiple contribs on Habit. However, it's not very HTML-y, and makes people mad.
     We'll re-visit this conversation after the rewrite is done.
  1. Stylus. We're either staying here or moving to LESS, but vanilla CSS isn't cutting it for our app.
