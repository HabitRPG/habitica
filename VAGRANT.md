# Vagrant #

Vagrant is a system to create reproducible and portable development
environments. Because of the variety of systems used for Habitica
development and the various issues developers may encounter setting up
Habitica on them, vagrant provides a single development enviroment with
minimal dependencies on the developer's local platform. It can be used
on a variety of systems including Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

Instructions for using the Habitica Vagrant environment are in
[Setting up Habitica Locally](http://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Setting_up_Habitica_Locally).
