# Introduction

This webpage includes the documentation for version 3 of the [Habitica](https://habitica.com) API.

If you're developing a 3rd party tool that uses the Habitica API you should read the [Guidance for Comrades](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guidance_for_Comrades) and in particular the section called [Rules for Third-Party Tools](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guidance_for_Comrades#Rules_for_Third-Party_Tools) which includes suggestions on how to best use the API and the rules to follow when interacting with it.

# Attention: Sample forms are non-functional
The sample forms were enabled [due to a change in the apidoc package](https://github.com/apidoc/apidoc/pull/915) and do not function, they will be disabled in a future release.
