# Introduction

This webpage includes the documentation for version 3 of the [Habitica](https://habitica.com) API.

If you're developing a 3rd party tool that uses the Habitica API you should read the [Guidance for Comrades](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guidance_for_Comrades) and in particular the section called [Rules for Third-Party Tools](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Guidance_for_Comrades#Rules_for_Third-Party_Tools) which includes suggestions on how to best use the API and the rules to follow when interacting with it.
