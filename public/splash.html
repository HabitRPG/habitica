                    <h1>Habits</h1>
                </div>
                <p class="lead">Habits are situational goals that you constantly track. You can either try to break bad habits or reinforce good ones. You may encounter some habits multiple times a day (like "Floss After Eating"), and some you may not encounter often at all (like "Replace the Toilet Paper When it Runs Out"). For some habits, it only makes sense to gain points (like "Do One Hour of Productive Work"). For others, it only makes sense to lose points (like "Eat Junk Food"). For the rest, both gain and loss apply (like for "Take The Stairs", taking the stairs would be a gain while taking the elevator would be a loss).</p>

            <section>
                <div class="page-header">
                    <h1>Dailies</h1>
                </div>
                <p class="lead">Dailies are goals that you want to complete once a day, building them into your routine (like "Workout for 30 Minutes"). Unlike Habits, Dailies may only be checked off once a day. Also unlike habits, at the end of each day non-completed Dailies will cause damage, making you lose Hit Points. If you are doing well and consistantly check off a Daily day after day, it will turn green and earn less gold and experience, though it will also cause you to lose fewer Hit Points if you skip it. This means you can ease up on it for a bit. Conversely, if you are doing poorly and fail to check something off every day, it will turn red. The worse you do, the more experience and gold that Daily is worth and the more hit points it takes away if left uncompleted. This encourages you to focus on your shortcomings, the reds. Oh, and don't worry. You can make a Daily active only for certain days of the week, so weekday tasks won't pester you on the weekends. Or you can make a Daily active only on Mondays, thus creating a weekly task.</p>

                    <h1>Todos</h1>
                </div>
                <p class="lead">Todos are one-time goals which need to be completed eventually (like "Wash the car" or "Buy milk"). Non-completed Todos won’t hurt you, but they will become more valuable over time. This will encourage you to wrap up stale Todos.</p>

                <div class="page-header">
                    <h1>Rewards</h1>
                </div>
                <p class='lead'>As you complete goals, you earn gold to buy rewards that you create (like "An Hour of Video Games"). Create plenty of rewards and buy them liberally! Rewarding good performance is the best way to reinforce good habits. If you really need a reward but don't have enough gold, you can still make a purchase. But be careful because it will cost you Hit Points!</p>
                <p class='lead'>After you’ve reached level 2, you unlock the <strong>Item Store</strong> under the rewards column. You can now buy weapons, armor, and potions. Armor keeps you protected by reducing how much damage you take from failed tasks. Weapons increase how much experience you gain for completing a task. Potions recover 15 HP, for when you've piled just a little too much onto your schedule.</p>
